      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 141.1</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Liability of importer for duties.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time duties accrue.</E> Duties and the liability for their payment accrue upon imported merchandise on arrival of the importing vessel within a Customs port with the intent then and there to unlade, or at the time of arrival within the Customs territory of the United States if the merchandise arrives otherwise than by vessel, unless otherwise specially provided for by law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment of duties</E>—(1) <E T="03">Personal debt of importer.</E> The liability for duties, both regular and additional, attaching on importation, constitutes a personal debt due from the importer to the United States which can be discharged only by payment in full of all duties legally accruing, unless relieved by law or regulation. Payment to a broker covering duties does not relieve the importer of liability if the duties are not paid by the broker. The liability may be enforced notwithstanding the fact that an erroneous construction of law or regulation may have enabled the importer to pass his goods through the customhouse without payment. Delivery of a Customs bond with an entry is solely to protect the revenue of the United States and does not relieve the importer of liabilities incurred from the importation of merchandise into the United States.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Means of payment.</E> An importer or his agent may pay Customs by using any of the applicable means provided in § 24.1(a).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Methods of payment.</E> An importer may pay duties either:</P>
            <P>(i) Directly to Customs whether or not a licensed customhouse broker is used; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Through a licensed customhouse broker. When an importer uses a broker and elects to pay by check or bank draft, the importer may issue the broker either:</P>
            <P>(A) One check or bank draft payable to the broker covering both duties and the broker's fees and charges, in which case the broker shall pay the duties to Customs on behalf of the importer, or</P>
            <P>(B) Separate checks or bank drafts, one covering duties payable to the “U.S. Customs Service,” for transmittal by the broker to Customs, and the other covering the broker's fees and charges. The importer's check or bank draft for duties shall be delivered to Customs by the broker.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Claim against estate of importer.</E> The claim of the Government for unpaid duties against the estate of a deceased or insolvent importer has priority over obligations to creditors other than the United States. To the <PRTPAGE P="8"/>extent that a broker or a surety pays duties on behalf of an importer which files for bankruptcy protection, the broker or surety shall be entitled to assume the priority status of Customs under section 507(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code for that portion of Customs claim which the surety or broker has paid.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Lien against merchandise.</E> The liability for duties also constitutes a lien upon the merchandise imported which may be enforced while such merchandise is in the custody or subject to the control of the United States.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">States and their instrumentalities.</E> Neither the States nor their instrumentalities are entitled to any constitutional exemption from the payment of Customs duties.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Unordered merchandise.</E> There shall be no liability for the payment of duties on the part of anyone to whom merchandise is consigned without his authority, if he refuses it. Such merchandise shall be treated as unclaimed (see part 27 of this chapter).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Liability for duties on reimportation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Dutiable merchandise imported and afterwards exported, even though duty thereon may have been paid on the first importation, is liable to duty on every subsequent importation into the Customs territory of the United States, but this does not apply to the following:</P>
            <P>(a) Personal and household effects taken abroad by a resident of the United States and brought back on his return to this country (see § 148.31 of this chapter);</P>
            <P>(b) Professional books, implements, instruments, and tools of trade, occupation, or employment taken abroad by an individual and brought back on his return to this country (see § 148.53 of this chapter);</P>
            <P>(c) Automobiles and other vehicles taken abroad for noncommercial use (see § 148.32 of this chapter);</P>
            <P>(d) Metal boxes, casks, barrels, carboys, bags, quicksilver flasks or bottles, metal drums, or other substantial outer containers exported from the United States empty and returned as usual containers or coverings of merchandise, or exported filled with products of the United States and returned empty or as the usual containers or coverings of merchandise (see § 10.7(b), (c), (d), and (e) of this chapter);</P>

            <SUBJECT>Single entry for split shipments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">At election of importer of record.</E> At the election of the importer of record, Customs may process a split shipment, pursuant to section 484(j)(2), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(2)), under a single entry, as prescribed under the procedures set forth in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Split shipment defined.</E> A “split shipment”, for purposes of this section, means a shipment:</P>
            <P>(1) Which may be accommodated on a single conveyance, and which is delivered to and accepted by a carrier in the exporting country under one bill of lading or waybill, and is thus intended by the importer of record to arrive in the United States as a single shipment;</P>
            <P>(2) Which is thereafter divided by the carrier, acting on its own, into different portions which are transported and consigned to the same party in the United States; and</P>
            <P>(3) Of which the first portion and all succeeding portions arrive at the same port of entry in the United States, as listed in the original bill of lading or waybill; and all the succeeding portions arrive at the port of entry within 10 calendar days of the date of the first portion. If any portion of the shipment arrives at a different port, such portion must be transported in-bond to the port of destination where entry of the shipment is made.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification by importer of record.</E> The importer of record must notify Customs, in writing, that the shipment has been split at the carrier's initiative, that the remainder of the shipment will arrive by subsequent conveyance(s), and that an election is being made to file a single entry for all portions. The required notification must be given as soon as the importer of record becomes aware that the shipment has been split, but in all cases notification must be made before the entry summary is filed.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Entry or special permit for immediate delivery.</E> In order to make a single entry for a split shipment or obtain a special permit for the release of a split shipment under immediate delivery, an importer of record may follow the procedure prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Entry or special permit after arrival of entire shipment.</E> An importer of record may file an entry at such time as all portions of the split shipment have arrived at the port of entry (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section). In the alternative, again after the arrival of all portions of a split shipment at the <PRTPAGE P="19"/>port of entry, the importer of record may instead file a special permit for immediate delivery provided that the merchandise is eligible for such a permit under § 142.21(a)-(f) and (h) of this chapter. In either case, the importer of record must file Customs Form (CF) 3461 or CF 3461 alternate (CF 3461 ALT) as appropriate, or electronic equivalent, with Customs. The entry or special permit must indicate the total number of pieces in, as well as the total value of, the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice(s) covering the shipment.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Special permit prior to arrival of entire shipment.</E> As provided in § 142.21(g) of this chapter, an importer of record may also file a special permit for immediate delivery after the arrival of the first portion of a split shipment at the port of entry (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section), but before the arrival of the entire shipment at such port, thus qualifying the split shipment for incremental release, under paragraph (e) of this section, as each portion of the shipment arrives at the port of entry (see paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section). In such case, a CF 3461 or CF 3461 ALT as appropriate, or electronic equivalent, must be filed with Customs. As each portion arrives at the port of entry, the importer of record must submit a copy of the CF 3461/CF 3461 ALT, or its electronic equivalent, adjusted to reflect the quantity of that particular portion relative to the quantity contained in the entire split shipment (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section); however, if both the carrier and the importer of record are automated, such adjustments may instead be made electronically to the CBP Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or any other CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system. In the event that an entry has been pre-filed with Customs (see § 142.2(b) of this chapter), notification to Customs by the importer of record that a single entry will be filed for shipments released incrementally will serve as a request that the pre-filed entry be converted to an application for a special permit for immediate delivery (see § 142.21(g) of this chapter). The special permit must indicate the total number of pieces in, as well as the total value of, the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice(s) covering the shipment. Customs may limit the release of each portion of the split shipment upon arrival at the port of entry, as permitted under this paragraph, due to the need to examine the merchandise in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Release.</E> To secure the separate release upon arrival of each portion of a split shipment at the port of destination under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the carrier responsible for initially splitting the shipment must present to Customs, either on a paper manifest or through an authorized electronic data interchange system, manifest information relating to the shipment that reflects exact information for each portion of the split shipment. The carrier responsible for splitting the shipment must notify other obligated entities (such as another carrier or freight forwarder) that have submitted electronic manifest information to Customs about the shipment that was split so that these parties can update their manifest information to Customs.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Examination.</E> Customs may require examination of any or all parts of the split shipment. For split shipments subject to the immediate delivery procedure of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, Customs reserves the right to deny incremental release should such an examination of the merchandise be necessary. The denial of incremental release does not preclude the use of the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Entry summary</E>—(1) <E T="03">Entry.</E> For merchandise entered under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the importer of record must file an entry summary within 10 working days from the time of entry.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Release for immediate delivery</E>—(i) <E T="03">Release under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</E> For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the importer of record must file the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, within 10 working days after the merchandise or any part of the merchandise is authorized for release under the <PRTPAGE P="20"/>special permit or, for quota class merchandise, within the quota period, whichever expires first (see § 142.23 of this chapter).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Release under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</E> For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the importer of record must file the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, within 10 working days from the date of the first release of a portion of the split shipment. The filed entry summary must reflect all portions of the split shipment which have been released, to include quantity, value, correct classification and rate of duty. The entry summary cannot include any portions of the split shipment which have not been released.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duty payment.</E> With the entry summary filed under paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the importer of record must attach estimated duties, taxes and fees applicable to the released merchandise. If the entry summary is filed electronically, the estimated duties, taxes and fees must be scheduled for payment at such time pursuant to the Automated Clearinghouse (see § 24.25 of this chapter).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Classification.</E> For purposes of section 484(j)(2), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(2)), the merchandise comprising the separate portions of a split shipment included on one entry will be classified as though imported together.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Separate entry required</E>—(1) <E T="03">Untimely arrival.</E> The importer of record must enter separately those portions of a split shipment that do not arrive at the port of entry within 10 calendar days of the portion that arrived there first (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Different rates of duty for identically classified merchandise.</E> An importer of record will be required to file a separate entry for any portion of a split shipment if necessary to preclude the application of different rates of duty on a split shipment entry for merchandise that is classifiable under the same subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Requirement of importer of record to review entry and maintain evidence substantiating splitting of shipment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Review of entry.</E> The importer of record will be responsible for reviewing the total manifested quantity shown on the CF 3461/CF 3461 ALT, or electronic equivalent, in relation to all portions of the split shipment that arrived at the port of entry under paragraph (b)(3) of this section within the specified 10 calendar day period. At the conclusion of the specified 10 calendar day period, the importer of record must make any adjustments necessary to reflect the actual amount, value, correct classification and rate of duty of the merchandise that was released incrementally under the split shipment procedures. If all portions of the split shipment do not arrive within the required 10 calendar day period, the importer of record must file an additional entry or entries as appropriate to cover any remaining portions of the split shipment that subsequently arrive (see paragraph (i)(1) of this section).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Evidence for splitting of shipment; recordkeeping.</E> The importer of record must maintain sufficient documentary evidence to substantiate that the splitting of the shipment was done by the carrier acting on its own, and not at the request of the foreign shipper and/or the importer of record. This documentation should include a copy of the originating bill of lading or waybill under which the shipment was delivered to the carrier in the country of exportation or other supporting documentary evidence, such as a letter from the carrier confirming that the splitting of the shipment was done by the carrier on its own initiative. This documentary evidence as well as all other necessary records received or generated by or on behalf of the importer of record under this section must be maintained and produced, if requested, in accordance with part 163 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Single entry limited; exclusions from single entry under incremental release procedure</E>—(1) <E T="03">Quota/visa merchandise.</E> Merchandise subject to quota and/or visa requirements is excluded from incremental release under the immediate delivery procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and <PRTPAGE P="21"/>§ 142.21(g) of this chapter. Additionally, if by splitting a shipment any portion of it is subject to quota, no portion of the split shipment may be released incrementally.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Other merchandise.</E> In addition, the port director may deny the use of the incremental release procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 142.21(g) of this chapter, as circumstances warrant.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Limited single entry available.</E> For merchandise described in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, that is excluded from the immediate delivery procedure of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 142.21(g) of this chapter, the importer of record may still file a single entry or special permit for immediate delivery under paragraph (d)(1) of this section covering the entire split shipment of such merchandise following, and to the extent of, its arrival within the required 10 calendar day period.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Single entry for separately arriving portions of unassembled or disassembled entities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">At election of importer of record.</E> At the election of the importer of record, an unassembled or disassembled entity arriving on multiple conveyances as contemplated under section 484(j)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(1)), may be processed as a single entry, as prescribed under the procedures set forth in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Unassembled or disassembled entities covered.</E> An unassembled or disassembled entity for purposes of this section is an entity which:</P>
            <P>(1) Cannot, due to its size or nature, be shipped on a single conveyance, and is thus imported in an unassembled or disassembled condition;</P>
            <P>(2) Is ordered, invoiced and is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as a single entity and is consigned to one person in the United States;</P>
            <P>(3) Is imported on more than one conveyance to the same port of entry in the United States; and</P>
            <P>(4) Involves the first portion and all succeeding portions arriving at the same United States port of entry within either:</P>
            <P>(i) 15 calendar days after the unlading of the first portion or arrival at the destination port if transported in bond for entities entered under the “hold all” method permitted in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(ii) 10 calendar days after the release of the first portion under special permit procedures for entities released incrementally as permitted in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Application by importer.</E> The importer of record must apply to file a single entry covering an entity described in paragraph (b) of this section. Applications may be made either by appropriately annotating a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Form 3461, CBP Form 3461 ALT, or electronic equivalent, or by submitting a letter to CBP. The required application must be made no later than 5 working days in advance of the arrival of the first conveyance. Justification for the need for more than one conveyance must be provided in the application, which must include an affirmative statement that the entity cannot, due to its size or nature, be shipped on one conveyance. A copy of the relevant invoice or purchase order, or electronic equivalent, must accompany the application, along with the proposed appropriate single tariff number under the HTSUS. The port director will notify the applicant of the approval or denial of the application within 3 working days of the receipt of the application.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Entry or special permit for immediate delivery.</E> In order to make a single entry for portions of an entity covered under this section that arrive at different times, an importer of record must follow the procedure prescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Entry or special permit after arrival of all portions (Hold All).</E> An importer may file an entry at such time as all portions of the entity have arrived at the same port of entry in the United States. Any portion that arrives at a different port must be transported in-bond to the destination port where entry will be made. In the alternative, <PRTPAGE P="22"/>the importer may file a special permit for immediate delivery after arrival of all portions of the entity provided that it is eligible for such a permit under § 142.21(a)-(d), (f) and (i) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Special permit for immediate delivery after arrival of first portion (Incremental Release).</E> As provided in § 142.21(h) of this chapter, an importer of record may file an application for a special permit for immediate delivery after the arrival of the first portion of the entity covered by paragraph (b) of this section, and its remaining portions may be released incrementally pursuant to the requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. All portions of the shipment must timely arrive at the same port of entry in the United States. Any portion that arrives at a different port must be transported in-bond to the destination port where entry will be made.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Release.</E> If an importer wishes to secure release of an entity under paragraph (d)(1) of this section after the entity's arrival, the importer must file with CBP a CBP Form 3461 or CBP Form 3461 ALT, as appropriate, or electronic equivalent. To secure the separate release upon arrival of each portion of a shipment under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the importer must file with CBP a CBP Form 3461 or CBP Form 3461 ALT, as appropriate, or electronic equivalent after arrival of the first portion. As each successive portion arrives, the importer must submit a copy of the originally submitted CBP Form 3461/CBP Form 3461 ALT, annotated to specifically identify that particular portion. The CBP Form 3461/CBP Form 3461 ALT must indicate the order of the arriving portion in relation to the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice (for example, third of six portions). If both the carrier and the importer are automated, such adjustments may be made electronically through the CBP Automated Commercial System (ACS). The release of each portion upon arrival as permitted under this paragraph may be restricted due to CBP's need to examine the merchandise in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, the importer of record must present to CBP either on paper or through an authorized electronic equivalent, specific and detailed information supplementing the CBP Form 3461 or 3461 ALT, relating to the merchandise on each conveyance which reflects exact information for that portion of the ordered entity (for example, detailed packing lists).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Examination.</E> CBP may require examination of any or all portions of the entity. CBP reserves the right to deny the release of each portion of such shipments as they arrive (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, incremental release) should such an examination of the merchandise be necessary. The denial of incremental release does not preclude the use of the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Entry summary.</E> (1) For merchandise entered under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an entry summary must be filed within 10 working days from the time of entry. For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery, the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and entry summary, must be filed within 10 working days after the first portion of the entity is authorized for release under the special permit.</P>
            <P>(2) For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, must be filed within 10 working days from the date of the first release of a portion of the unassembled or disassembled entity. However, the entry/entry summary for the entity cannot be filed before the last portion of the entity which is to be included on the entry has arrived.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duty payment.</E> At the time the entry summary is filed under paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, estimated duties, taxes and fees must be attached. If the entry summary is filed electronically, the estimated duties, taxes and fees must be scheduled for payment at such time pursuant to the Automated Clearinghouse procedures (<E T="03">see</E> 19 CFR 24.25).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Classification.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, for purposes of section 484(j)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(1)), the merchandise comprising the separate portions of an entity covered by paragraph (b) of this section included on one entry will <PRTPAGE P="23"/>be classified as though imported together. Any spare parts accompanying a portion of an entity must be classified and entered separately.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">When separate entry and entry summary required.</E> When all portions of an entity do not arrive at the port of entry within the time constraints of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable, a separate entry and entry summary must be filed for each portion that has already arrived, and for each portion that subsequently will arrive on separate conveyances. The merchandise included on each separate entry shall be classified in its condition as imported. Each entry would reflect the quantities, values, classifications and rates of duty, as appropriate, of the various components conveyed in each shipment, and not the value or classification of the ordered single entity.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> Merchandise subject to quota and/or visa requirements is entirely excluded from the procedures set forth in this section. Also, CBP reserves the right for the port director to deny use of the incremental release procedure and only release the shipment in its entirety as circumstances warrant, such as in the case where a particular shipment has been selected for examination.</P>

The Center director may require additional documentation to substantiate the statistical information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The importer must give an appropriate bond for the production of the required documentation, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Except for merchandise entered for warehouse, the documentation must be produced within 50 days after the entry summary (or the entry, if there is no entry summary) is required to be filed.</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Rejection of form.</E> The Center director will reject a form for failure to provide required statistical information if the information is omitted or if the information provided clearly appears on its face, or is known to the CBP officer, to be erroneous.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Penalty procedures; when not invoked.</E> Penalty procedures relating to erroneous statistical information will not be invoked against any person who in good faith attempts to comply with the statistical requirements of the General Statistical Note, HTSUS.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Value of each invoice</E>—(1) <E T="03">Single invoice.</E> If the entry, entry summary, or withdrawal documentation, as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, covers a single invoice, the invoice information must be restated to show:</P>
            <P>(i) Gross amount of the invoice;</P>

The required information must be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 and 31 on CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the importer or his agent elects the second option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice must be restated for each invoice. The final amount in the summary computation must represent the aggregate of the entered values of all the merchandise on each of the multiple invoices. The required information must be shown on an attached worksheet.</P>
            <P>(iii) The worksheet also must contain:</P>

                <E T="03">Definitions</E> for some of the terms used in questions A to Z above: For the purpose of this section, the following terms have the approximate definitions below. If either a more complete definition or a decision as to its application to a particular article is needed, the maker or importer of record (or the agent of either) should contact Customs prior to entry of the article.</P>
              <P>a. In an <E T="03">exclusively adhesive construction,</E> all of the piece(s) of the bottom would separate from the upper or from each other if all adhesives, cements, and glues were dissolved. It includes shoes in which the pieces of the upper are stitched to each other, but not to any part of the bottom. Examples include:</P>
              <P>1. Vulcanized construction footwear;</P>
              <P>2. Simultaneous molded construction footwear;</P>
              <P>3. Molded footwear in which the upper and the bottom are one piece of molded rubber or plastic, and</P>
              <P>4. Footwear in which staples, rivets, stitching, or any of the methods above are either primary or just extra or auxiliary, even though adhesive is a major part of the reason the bottom will not separate from the upper.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Composition leather</E> is made by binding together leather fibers or small pieces of natural leather. It does not include imitation leathers not based on natural leather.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Leather</E> is the tanned skin of any animal from which the fur or hair has been removed. Tanned skins coated or laminated with rubber and/or plastics are “leather” only if the leather gives the material its essential character.</P>
              <P>d. A <E T="03">line of demarcation</E> exists if one can indicate where the sole ends and the upper begins. For example, knit booties do not normally have a line of demarcation.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Men's, boys' and youths'</E> sizes cover footwear of American youths sizes 11<FR>1/2</FR> and larger for males, and do not include footwear commonly worn by both sexes. If more than 4% of the shoes sold in a given size will be worn by females, that size is “commonly worn by both sexes.”</P>
              <P>f. Footwear is designed to <E T="03">protect</E> against water, oil or cold or inclement weather only if it is substantially more of a protection against those items than the usual shoes of that type. For example, leather oxfords will clearly keep one's feet warmer and drier than going barefoot, but they are not a protection in this sense. On the other hand the snow-jobber is the protective version of the nonprotective jogging shoe.</P>
              <P>g. <E T="03">Rubber and/or plastics</E> includes any textile material visibly coated (or covered) externally with one or both of those materials.</P>
              <P>h. <E T="03">Slip-on</E> includes:</P>
              <P>1. A boot which must be pulled on.</P>
              <P>2. Footwear with elastic cores which must be stretched to get it on, but not bootwear having a separate piece of elasticized fabric which forms a full circle around the foot or ankle.</P>
              <P>i. <E T="03">Sports footwear</E> includes only:</P>
              <P>(1) Footwear which is designed for a sporting activity and has, or has provision for, the attachment of spikes, sprigs, cleats, stops, clips, bars or the like;</P>
              <P>(2) Skating boots (without skates attached), ski boots and cross-country ski footwear, wrestling boots, boxing boots and cycling shoes.</P>
              <P>j. <E T="03">Tennis shoes, basketball shoes, gym shoes, training shoes and the like</E> covers athletic footwear other than sports footwear, whether or not principally used for such athletic games or purposes.</P>
              <P>k. <E T="03">Textile materials</E> are made from cotton, other vegetable fibers, wool, hair, silk or man-made fibers. Note: Cork, wood carboard and leather are not textile materials.</P>
              <P>l. In <E T="03">turned</E> construction, the upper is stitched to the leather sole wrong side out and the shoe is then turned right side out.</P>

            <P>(h) <E T="03">Satisfaction of lien.</E> The port director shall not adjudicate any dispute respecting the validity of any lien, but when the amount of such lien depends upon the quantity or weight of merchandise actually landed, the port director shall hold the lien satisfied upon <PRTPAGE P="45"/>the payment of an amount computed upon the basis of the official Customs report of quantity and weight. In all other cases, proof that the lien has been satisfied or discharged shall consist of a written release or receipt signed by the claimant and filed with the port director, showing payment of the claim in full.</P>

The demand for marking or labeling shall be made not later than 30 days after the date of entry in the case of merchandise examined in public stores, and places of arrival, such as docks, wharfs, or piers. Demand may be made no later than 30 days after the date of examination in the case of merchandise examined at the importer's premises or such other appropriate places as determined by the port director or Center director.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Textiles and textile products.</E> For purposes of determining whether the country of origin of textiles and textile products subject to the provisions of § 102.21 or § 102.22 of this chapter, as applicable, has been accurately represented to CBP, the release from CBP custody of any such textile or textile product shall be deemed conditional during the 180-day period following the date of release. If the port director finds during the conditional release period that a textile or textile product is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United States because the country of origin of the textile or textile product was not accurately represented to CBP, he shall promptly demand its return to CBP custody. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section and § 113.62(m)(1) of this chapter, a failure to comply with a demand for return to CBP custody made under this paragraph shall result in the assessment of liquidated damages equal to the value of the merchandise involved.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Food, drugs, devices, cosmetics, and tobacco products</E>—(1) <E T="03">Conditional release period.</E> For purposes of determining the admissibility of any food, drug, device, cosmetic, or tobacco product imported pursuant to section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)), as amended, the release from CBP custody of any such product will be deemed conditional. Unless extended in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the conditional release period will terminate upon the earliest occurring of the following events:</P>
            <P>(i) The date that FDA issues a notice of refusal of admission;</P>
            <P>(ii) The date that FDA issues a notice that the merchandise may proceed; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Upon the end of the 30-day period following the date of release.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Extension of conditional release period.</E> The conditional release period provided under this paragraph (c) may be extended. The FDA must issue a written or electronic notice of sampling, detention, or other FDA action to the bond principal (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, importer of record) within 30 days of the release of the merchandise in order for the extension of the conditional release period to be valid.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Issuance of a redelivery notice.</E> If FDA refuses admission of a food, drug, device, cosmetic, or tobacco product into the United States, or if any notice of sampling or other request is not complied with, FDA will communicate <PRTPAGE P="46"/>that fact to the Center director. An authorized CBP official will demand the redelivery of the product to CBP custody. CBP will issue a notice of redelivery within 30 days from the date the product was refused admission by the FDA or from the date FDA determined the noncompliance with a notice of sampling or other request. The demand for redelivery may be made contemporaneously with the notice of refusal issued by the FDA. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, a failure to comply with a demand for redelivery made under this paragraph (c) will result in the assessment of liquidated damages equal to three times the value of the merchandise involved unless the port director has prescribed a bond equal to the domestic value of the merchandise pursuant to § 12.3(b) of this Chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Other merchandise not entitled to admission.</E> If at any time after entry an authorized CBP official finds that any merchandise contained in an importation is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United States for any reason not enumerated in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, an authorized CBP official shall promptly demand the return to CBP custody of any such merchandise which has been released.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Request for samples or additional examination packages not complied with by importer.</E> If the importer has not promptly complied with a request for samples or additional examination packages made by an authorized CBP official pursuant to § 151.11 of this chapter, an authorized CBP official may demand the return of the necessary merchandise to CBP custody.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Demand to importer of record or actual owner.</E> A demand for the return of merchandise to CBP custody shall be made on the importer of record, except that it shall be made on the actual owner if an actual owner's declaration and superseding bond have been filed in accordance with § 141.20 before the date of the demand.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Form of demand.</E> A demand for the return of merchandise to CBP custody shall be made on Customs Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent, or other appropriate form, or by letter. One copy, with the date of mailing or delivery noted thereon, shall be retained by an authorized CBP official and made part of the entry record.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Time limitation.</E> A demand for the return of merchandise to CBP custody shall not be made after the liquidation of the entry covering such merchandise has become final.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Demand not complied with.</E> When the demand of an authorized CBP official for return of merchandise to CBP custody is not complied with, liquidated damages shall be assessed, except in the case of merchandise entered under chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), in an amount equal to the value of the merchandise not returned or three times the value of the merchandise not returned if the merchandise is restricted or prohibited merchandise or alcoholic beverages, as determined at the time of entry. The amount of liquidated damages to be assessed on merchandise entered under chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS is set forth in § 10.39(d)(3) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Placement on CBP forms.</E> The importer or broker shall place an 11 character entry number on the entry and corresponding entry summary documentation. For documentation prepared on data processing equipment, the number shall be printed directly on the form. For manually prepared documentation, the number shall be pre-printed in a machine readable format specified by CBP. The same number shall not be used for more than one entry transaction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Format.</E> The following format, including hyphens, must be used when showing the entry number:
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">XXX-NNNNNNN-N</HD>
              
              <FP>XXX represents an entry filer code assigned by CBP, NNNNNNN is a unique number which is assigned by the broker or importer, and N is a check digit computed from the first 10 characters based on a formula provided by CBP.</FP>
            </EXTRACT>
            
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Assignment of entry filer code.</E> CBP will assign a unique 3 character (alphabetic, numeric, or alpha numeric) entry filer code to all licensed brokers filing CBP entries. CBP will assign an entry filer code to certain importers filing CBP entries based on importer entry volume, frequency of entry filing, and other considerations. The broker or importer shall use this assigned code as the beginning three characters of the number for all CBP entries, regardless of where the entries are filed.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Entry filer assigned number.</E> For each entry, the broker or importer shall assign a unique 7 digit number. This number shall not be assigned to more than one transaction.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Check digit.</E> The broker or importer is responsible for ensuring that <PRTPAGE P="49"/>the check digit is computed by data processing equipment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Pulication of entry filer codes.</E> CBP shall make available electronically a listing of filer codes and the importers, consignees, and customs brokers assigned those filer codes. The listing will be updated periodically.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Misuse of the entry filer code.</E> The Assistant Commissioner, Office of International Trade, or his designee may refuse to allow use of an assigned entry filer code if it is misused by the importer or broker.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Alternative procedure.</E> If an importer does not have an assigned entry filer code, or if the Assistant Commissioner, Office of International Trade, or his designee, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section refuses to allow use of an assigned entry filer code, the importer or broker shall obtain forms with a CBP assigned pre-printed machine readable entry number with a computed check digit.

            <SUBJECT>Merchandise eligible for special permit for immediate delivery.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Merchandise may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery, in accordance with section 448(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)), in the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Contiguous countries.</E> At the discretion of the port director, merchandise arriving by land from Canada or Mexico may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery provided the importer has on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter. An entry summary shall be filed in accordance with § 142.22(b)(1), and estimated duties, if any, shall be deposited, within the time period specified in § 142.23 for all merchandise from contiguous countries released under a special permit except for fresh fruits and vegetables for human consumption released under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fresh fruits and vegetables.</E> (1) An application for a special permit for immediate delivery may be made for the transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables for human consumption arriving <PRTPAGE P="55"/>from Canada or Mexico to the importer's premises within the port of importation, but removed from the area immediately contiguous to the border.</P>
            <P>(2) The application shall be accompanied by a continuous bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3) The fresh fruits and vegetables shall be transported to the importer's premises in the vehicles in which they crossed the border or, if transshipment is necessary in vehicles provided by the importer. The fresh fruits and vegetables may be examined at the importer's premises. Those portions without commercial value may be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of § 158.11(b) of this chapter, and the balance shall be entered for consumption or transported in bond under an entry for immediate transportation without appraisement or under an entry for transportation and exportation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Agency of U.S. Government.</E> Merchandise may be released under the immediate delivery procedure if the shipment is consigned to or for the account of any agency or office of the United States Government, or to an officer or official of any such agency in his official capacity, as provided in § 10.101 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Articles of a trade fair.</E> Articles for a trade fair may be released under the immediate delivery procedure, as provided in § 147.13 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Quota-class merchandise</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tariff rate quotas.</E> At the discretion of the port director, merchandise subject to a tariff-rate quota may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery provided the importer has on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter. However, merchandise subject to a tariff-rate quota may not be incrementally released under a special permit for immediate delivery as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. Nor is such merchandise eligible for release under a special permit pursuant to 19 CFR 141.58(d)(1). Where a special permit is authorized, an entry summary will be properly presented pursuant to § 132.1 of this chapter within the time specified in § 142.23, or within the quota period, whichever expires first. If proper presentation is not made until after the tariff-rate quota is filled, the merchandise shall not be entitled to the quota rate of duty, and the importer shall pay duties at the over-quota rate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Absolute quotas.</E> At the discretion of the port director, perishable merchandise of a class approved by CBP Headquarters which is subject to an absolute quota may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery for removal to the importer's premises, or to any other location approved by the port director, until an entry summary is properly presented pursuant to § 132.1 of this chapter. However, merchandise subject to an absolute quota under this paragraph may not be incrementally released under a special permit for immediate delivery as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. Nor is such merchandise eligible for release under a special permit pursuant to § 141.58(d)(1) of this chapter. Where a special permit is authorized, a proper entry summary must be presented for merchandise so released within the time specified in § 142.23, or within the quota period, whichever expires first. If the absolute quota is filled before the importer has properly presented an entry summary, he may either present an entry summary for warehouse or, under CBP supervision, export or destroy the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Release from warehouse followed by warehouse withdrawal for consumption.</E> Merchandise may be released from warehouse under a special permit:</P>
            <P>(1) At the discretion of the port director when:</P>
            <P>(i) The warehouse is located a considerable distance from the customhouse and actual release of the merchandise from the warehouse may not be effected within the next full business day after the day of the payment of duty, and</P>
            <P>(ii) The port has sufficient manpower to permit such practice;</P>
            <P>(2) The importer shall have on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter; and</P>

            <P>(3) The immediate delivery permit shall be annotated to state that a warehouse withdrawal for consumption will be filed for this merchandise.<PRTPAGE P="56"/>
            </P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Split shipments.</E> Merchandise subject to § 141.57(d)(2) of this chapter, which is invoiced and delivered to the carrier as a single shipment, but which, due to the carrier's inability to accommodate the merchandise on a single conveyance, is shipped by the carrier in separate portions to the same port of entry in the United States as listed on the original bill of lading, may be released incrementally under a special permit. Incremental release means releasing each portion of such shipments separately as they arrive.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Entities shipped unassembled or disassembled on multiple conveyances.</E> Merchandise subject to § 141.58(d)(2) of this chapter, which is purchased, invoiced, and classified as a single entity under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), and which is shipped in separate portions because its size or nature prevents shipping the entity on a single conveyance, may be released incrementally under a special permit.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">When authorized by Headquarters.</E> Headquarters may authorize the release of merchandise under the immediate delivery procedure in circumstances other than those described in § 142.21(a) through (h) provided a bond on CBP Form 301 containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter is on file.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Denial of Line Release application.</E> If the port director is considering the denial of a Line Release application, consideration shall be given to whether an application by the same filer for the same transaction has been approved at another port. If there is not an approved application at another port and the port director determines that the application shall be denied, the application shall be noted denied and returned to the entry filer without a C-4 Code annotation by the port director. If an application has been approved at another port, but the port director still questions whether the application should be approved at his port, the port director shall forward the application to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Information Management. The Office of Information and Technology will review the application and will notify the port director of the final determination.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Entry number range.</SUBJECT>

            <P>After an application for Line Release has received final approval, filers must provide the port director, in writing, with a range of entry numbers for use <PRTPAGE P="60"/>in the system so that an entry number can be assigned automatically to each Line Release transaction. For the purposes of this subpart, “entry number”, when the release is an immediate delivery, merely refers to the Line Release transaction number; this number does not become the actual entry number until an entry for the merchandise released under the immediate delivery procedure is filed. A separate range must be provided for each Line Release site at the port. These entry numbers shall be used for assignment within the Line Release system. Entry filers shall not assign these numbers to other entry transactions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Use of bar code by entry filer.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Printing of C-4 Code.</E> Upon receipt of an approved Line Release application, the entry filer, in accordance with instructions from the port director, shall preprint invoices with the C-4 Code in bar code and alpha-numeric format or print labels with the necessary information. Bar codes shall be printed in accordance with the specifications stated in Customs Publication 561 (<E T="03">Line Release Overview</E>). Labels or preprinted invoices also shall state the name of the shipper or manufacturer of the product and the name of the importer of record, if other than the entry filer, above the bar code and the name of the entry filer and a product description below the bar code.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multiple commodity processing.</E> Multiple commodity processing allows more than one product to be released under one entry number. The shipper/manufacturer, importer of record and the entry filer must be the same. The product description is the only variable allowed. The commodities should be listed on one invoice with C-4 Code labels for each commodity attached to the invoice.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Distribution of labels.</E> If labels are used, the labels shall be affixed to the invoices in accordance with instructions from the port director. The entry filer may either affix the labels or distribute the labels to the shippers/manufacturers and instruct them in the use and placement of the labels.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Presentation of invoice and assignment of entry number.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Presentation of invoice.</E> When merchandise that has been approved for Line Release is imported at a Line Release site, the carrier, importer or filer shall present Customs with an invoice with the bar code or codes printed or affixed and, according to the method of transportation, the appropriate manifest document.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Verification of data.</E> If after scanning the bar code at the Line Release site, the Customs officer verifies the data on the bar code with the information on the invoice, he will key the quantity on the invoice and an entry number will be automatically assigned to the transaction. If there are any differences between the system data and the invoice and bar code, including any differences in entry filer, the Customs officer shall order an examination.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Other agency documentation.</E> If the Line Release shipment requires other agency documentation, the Customs officer at the Line Release site will be alerted to that requirement electronically when he verifies the data on the bar code with the information on the invoice. If the required form is presented to the officer with the documentation package, the shipment may be released.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Examinations of Line Release transactions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Merchandise imported under Line Release generally may be released without further CBP processing. CBP, however, may choose to inspect any Line Release shipment. Examinations may be either specifically ordered by the CBP officer or random.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Voiding of Line Release transaction.</E> CBP may void a Line Release transaction for the following reasons: Because of an examination, because a carrier transporting the Line Release merchandise is not a participant in a CBP-approved industry partnership program, or because a driver or conveyance is not authorized in accordance with the LBCIP. If this occurs, CBP will return the invoice to the carrier, and the entry filer, in order to enter merchandise, must prepare and submit <PRTPAGE P="61"/>either a CF 3461 or 3461 Alternate, or its electronic equivalent.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">By entry filer.</E> Entry filers may delete C-4 Codes from Line Release by notifying the port director in writing on a Deletion Data Loading Sheet. Such notification shall state the C-4 Code which is to be deleted, the port where the C-4 Code is to be deleted and the reason for the requested deletion. A copy of the originally approved Data Loading Sheet must be submitted with the Deletion Data Loading Sheet. If only a temporary deletion is desired, the filer shall state the requested effective date for the deletion and the date the C-4 Code is requested to be returned to Line Release processing.</P>

            <P>An applicant who has already received a C-4 Code and wishes to change the election chosen on his Line Release application as to whether the release should be considered an entry or an immediate delivery must submit a letter requesting such change to the port director where the C-4 Code is used. This letter must include the C-4 Code to be changed and the date the change is to be effective. If the requested change is for a temporary time period, the letter shall include the date the releases are to return to the release type originally requested.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Participants for Importer Security Filing purposes.</E> Any party may participate in ABI solely for the purposes of filing the Importer Security Filing pursuant to § 149.2 of this chapter if that party fulfills the eligibility requirements contained in § 149.5 of this chapter. If a party other than a customs broker as defined in § 111.1 of this chapter or an importer as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1484 submits the Importer Security Filing, no portion of the Importer Security Filing can be used for entry or entry summary purposes pursuant to § 149.5 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Participants for other purposes.</E> Upon approval by CBP, any party may participate in ABI for other purposes, including transmission of protests, forms relating to in-bond movements (CBP Form 7512), and applications for FTZ admission (CBP Form 214).</P>

However, the port director may require the filing of a rewarehouse entry under § 144.41 if he determines it necessary for proper control of the merchandise. All charges shall be paid before merchandise is transferred from a warehouse of class 1 (see § 19.1 of this chapter for classes of warehouses). The quantities of goods so transferred shall be subject to the joint determination of the warehouse proprietor and the cartman, lighterman, or private bonded carrier, as provided in § 19.6 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">At another port.</E> Merchandise may be transferred to a warehouse which is under the jurisdiction of another port by withdrawing the merchandise for transportation in accordance with § 144.36 and entering it for rewarehouse in accordance with § 144.41 upon arrival at destination. All charges shall be paid before merchandise is transferred from the warehouse of class 1 (see § 19.1 of this chapter for classes of warehouses).</P>

            <P>(iii) The importer and its surety must sign the application. If the application to use this alternative procedure is approved by the appropriate port director, the importer's entry bond containing the conditions provided under § 113.62 of this chapter will continue to attach to any merchandise transferred under these alternative procedures.</P>
            <P>(iv) Each proprietor of a warehouse listed on the application and each surety who underwrites that proprietor's custodial bond coverage under § 113.63 of this chapter shall sign the application.</P>

The warehoused merchandise will be treated as though it remains in the first warehouse so long as the actual location of the merchandise at all times is recorded as provided under the provisions of this section.</P>

            <P>(ii) Provide Customs upon demand with the proper on-hand balance for each open warehouse entry and the actual quantity in each warehouse facility;</P>

            <P>(iii) If an alternative inventory system has been approved, provide Customs upon demand with the proper on-hand balance for each unique identifier and the quantity related to each open warehouse entry and the quantity in each warehouse facility;<PRTPAGE P="80"/>

            <P>(v) Maintain a consolidated permit file folder at the location where the merchandise was originally warehoused. The consolidated permit file folder must meet the requirements of § 19.12(d)(4) of this chapter regardless of the warehouse facility in which the action occurred. Documentation for all intracompany movements, including authorizations for movement, shipping documents, receiving reports, as well as documentation showing ultimate disposition of the merchandise must be filed in the consolidated permit file folder within seven business days;</P>
            <P>(vi) Maintain a subordinate permit file at all intracompany locations where merchandise is transferred containing copies of documentation required by § 19.12(d)(4) of this chapter and by paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section relating to merchandise quantities transferred to the location. A copy of all documents in the subordinate permit file folder must be filed in the consolidated permit file folder within seven business days; no exceptions will be granted to this requirement. When the final withdrawal is made on the respective entry, the subordinate permit file shall be considered closed and filed at the intracompany location to which the merchandise was transferred; and</P>
            <P>(vii) File the withdrawal from Customs custody at the original warehouse location at which the merchandise was entered.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Waiver of permit file folder requirements.</E> The permit file folder requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(v) and (c)(3)(vi) of this section may be waived if the proprietor's recordkeeping and inventory control system qualifies under the requirements of § 19.12(d)(4)(iii) of this chapter at all locations where bonded merchandise is stored.</P>

            <P>(ii) Warehouse entry number or specific identifier, if approved by the port director;</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 144.41</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Entry for rewarehouse.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> When merchandise which has been withdrawn from warehouse for transportation to another port has arrived at the port of destination, it may be entered for rewarehouse by the consignee named in the withdrawal.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of entry.</E> An entry for re-warehouse shall be made in duplicate on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, and shall contain all of the statistical information as provided in § 141.61(e) of this chapter. The port director may require an extra copy or copies of Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, annotated “PERMIT,” for use in connection with the delivery of the merchandise to the warehouse. No declaration is required on the entry.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Combining separate shipments.</E> (1) Separate shipments consigned to the same consignee and received under separate withdrawals for transportation may be combined into one rewarehouse <PRTPAGE P="85"/>entry if the warehouse withdrawals are from the same original warehouse entry.</P>
            <P>(2) Shipments covered by multiple warehouse entries, and shipped from a single warehouse under separate withdrawals for transportation, via a single conveyance, may be combined into one rewarehouse entry if consigned to the same consignee and deposited into a single warehouse. With the exception of alcohol and tobacco products, this procedure shall not be allowed for merchandise which is in any way restricted (for example, quota/visa). The combined rewarehouse entry shall have attached either copies of each warehouse entry package which is being combined into the single rewarehouse entry or a summary with pertinent information, that is, the date of importation, commodity description, size, HTSUS and entry numbers, for all entries withdrawn for consolidation as one rewarehouse entry. Any combining of separate withdrawals into one rewarehouse entry shall result in the rewarehouse entry being assigned the import date of the oldest entry being combined into the rewarehouse entry.</P>
            <P>(3) Combining of separate shipments shall be prohibited in all other circumstances.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Bond.</E> A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter shall be filed before a permit is issued on Customs Form 7501 for sending the merchandise to the bonded warehouse. However, no bond shall be required if the merchandise is entered by the consignee named in the original bond filed at the original port of entry, or if it is entered by a transferee who has established his right to withdraw the merchandise and has filed a bond in accordance with subpart C of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Value and classification.</E> The duties determined at the port where the original warehouse entry was filed shall be the duties chargeable under the rewarehouse entry, except in the cases provided for in §§ 159.7 (a) and (b) of this chapter, which pertain to certain classes of merchandise excluded from the liquidation of the original warehouse entry and merchandise on which rates of duty or tax are changed by an act of Congress or by a proclamation by the President.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Examination.</E> Any examination necessary for identification of the merchandise, determination of shortages, or other purposes shall be made.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to enter.</E> If the rewarehouse entry is not filed within 15 calendar days after its arrival, the merchandise shall be disposed of in accordance with the applicable procedures in § 4.37 or § 122.50 or § 123.10 of this chapter. However, merchandise sent to a general order warehouse shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of as unclaimed until the expiration of the original 5-year period during which the merchandise may remain in warehouse under bond.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Protest.</E> A protest may be filed with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically, against a liquidation made under § 159.7(a) or (b) of this chapter, or against a refusal to liquidate pursuant to said sections. In all other cases, any protest shall be filed against the original warehouse entry.</P>

No declaration is required on the entry;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Extra copy for Internal Revenue.</E> An additional copy of Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent marked or stamped “For Internal Revenue Purposes,” shall be presented for each entry of cigars, cigarettes, or cigarette papers or tubes, when the release from Customs custody of those articles is subject to part 275 of the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service (26 CFR part 275) and tax is payable to Customs; and</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Deposit of duties.</E> Estimated Customs duties, taxes, and other charges, as set forth in subpart G of part 141 of this chapter, shall be deposited upon presentation of the combined entry. The port director shall then issue a permit for release on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent.</P>

            <P>(a) He may pay the assessed duty, take delivery of the merchandise, and send a copy of the mail entry to the issuing CBP office indicated on the mail entry, together with a statement of the reason it is believed the duty assessed is incorrect. Any invoices, bills of sale, or other evidence should be submitted with the statement. The addressee may show the mail entry number and date on his statement instead of sending a copy of the mail entry, but this may result in delay.</P>
            <P>(b) He may postpone acceptance of the shipment, and within the time allowed by the Postal regulations provide the postmaster with a written statement of his objections. The postmaster will forward the mail entry together with the addressee's statement and any invoices, bills of sale, or other evidence submitted by the addressee to the port director who issued the entry, and retain custody of the shipment until advice is received from the port director as to the disposition to be made. If the addressee is located near one of the ports at which CBP officers are authorized to review mail entries (see 39 CFR 10.5), the postmaster may send the mail entry to that port, together with the addressee's statement and evidence, for reconsideration by the port director.</P>
            <P>(c) He may pay the assessed duty and take delivery of the merchandise, and file a protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), in the form and manner prescribed in part 174 of this chapter.

If a violation of law is discovered upon opening any mail article referred to in paragraph C, and it is believed that the correspondence may provide additional information concerning the violation and is therefore needed for further investigation or use in court, a search warrant shall be obtained before any correspondence is seized, read, or referred to another agency. Search warrants shall be promptly sought. Correspondence may be detained while a search warrant is being sought.</P>
            <P>E. If no controlled delivery is arranged and correspondence is not to be otherwise seized pursuant to a search warrant (see “F” below), the item which constitutes the violation shall be removed and any correspondence shall be replaced in the wrapper, or in a new wrapper if the original wrapper has been seized pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1595a. The wrapper shall then be resealed, marked to indicate it was opened by Customs, and returned to postal channels. Appropriate seizure notices shall be sent in accordance with 19 CFR 145.59(b).</P>
            <P>F. No mail article may be referred to another agency without a search warrant unless—</P>
            <P>(1) Any correspondence has been removed and the mail article is being referred for examination and clearance under 19 CFR 145.57,</P>
            <P>(2) Any correspondence has been removed and the mail article has been lawfully seized by Customs,</P>
            <P>(3) The mail article is being referred to Postal Service channels to effect a controlled delivery in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, or</P>
            <P>(4) The mail article is being returned to Postal Service channels for normal processing.</P>
            <P>G. Whenever sealed letter class mail is opened, the factors giving the Customs officer or employee “reasonable cause to suspect” the presence of merchandise or contraband shall be recorded on the appropriate form and on the opened envelope or other container by means of appropriate coded symbols. Should a seizure result, these factors shall also be recorded on the seizure report.</P>
            <P>H. Sealed letter class mail with the green Customs label on a Customs declaration may be opened without additional cause. Correspondence in such mail is subject to the restrictions regarding the detention, reading, and referral of mail to other agencies found in paragraphs C through F.</P>
            <P>I. Whenever any sealed letter class mail is opened for any of the reasons set forth in the above paragraphs, a Postal Service employee shall be present and shall observe the opening.</P>
            <P>J. Any violation of the Customs mail regulations or any of these policies will lead to appropriate administrative sanctions, as well as possible criminal prosecution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1702.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Part 145</HD>
            <P>A. <E T="03">Scope.</E> The Customs Service is authorized to examine, with certain exceptions for diplomatic and governmental mail, all mail arriving from outside the Customs territory of the United States (CTUS) which is to be delivered within the CTUS, and all mail arriving from outside the U.S. Virgin Islands which is to be delivered within the U.S. Virgin Islands. The term “Customs territory of the United States” is limited to the States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Consequently, mail arriving from other U.S. territories and possessions is subject to Customs examination even though it is designated “domestic” mail for Postal Service <PRTPAGE P="98"/>purposes. Likewise, mail in the APO/FPO military postal system is subject to Customs examination, even though it also is designated “domestic” mail for Postal Service purposes. The Customs Service therefor is responsible for examining all international mail to be delivered in the CTUS and certain limited categories of so-called “domestic mail”.</P>
            <P>B. <E T="03">Definitions.</E> Under various international conventions and bilateral agreements, international mail falls within two main classes, Parcel Post and Postal Union mail.</P>
            <P>Parcel Post is not permitted to contain correspondence but is to be used for the transmission of merchandise and is fully subject to Customs examination in the same manner as other merchandise shipments (e.g., luggage, cargo, containers, etc.). Postal Union mail is divided into “LC” mail (Lettres et Cartes) and “AO” mail (Aures Objets).</P>
            <P>“LC mail consists of letters, packages paid at the letter rate of postage, post cards, and aerogrammes. The term “letter class mail” as used in the Customs Regulations and in this policy statement means “LC” mail as well as equivalent articles in “domestic” mail subject to Customs examination. Equivalent articles in “domestic” mail would include articles mailed at the letter rate, or equivalent class or category, in the APO/FPO military system or from a U.S. territory or possession outside the CTUS. Since the term “letter class mail” thus includes packages and bulky envelopes as long as they are mailed at the letter rate, or equivalent class or category, the restrictions relating to opening and reading of correspondence apply equally to such packages or bulky envelopes.</P>
            <P>“AO” mail is to be treated in the same manner as Parcel Post mail since the Universal Postal Union Convention requires that they “be made up in such a manner that they may be easily examined” and generally are not permitted to “contain any document having the character of current and personal correspondence.” Exceptions to the latter requirement exist for matter for the blind and certain correspondence between school children. Because of these exceptions, the prohibition against reading correspondence without a search warrant or authorization of the sender or addressee applies to correspondence of the blind and correspondence between school children contained in “AO” mail. “AO” mail can usually be identified by the following words: “Imprime” or “Printed Matter”, “Cecogramme” or “Literature for the Blind”, “Petit Paquet” or “Small Packet” or similar terms or their equivalents.</P>
            <P>C. <E T="03">Reasonable Cause to Suspect.</E> Determining whether there is “reasonable cause to suspect” that merchandise or contraband is contained in sealed letter class mail is ultimately a matter of judgment for each Customs official, based on all relevant facts and circumstances. This judgment should be exercised within the framework of the Customs regulation that sealed letter class mail which appears to contain only correspondence is not to be opened unless a search warrant or written authorization from either the sender or the addressee has been obtained in advance of the opening.</P>
            <P>Past practice indicates that the following circumstances (which are illustrative and not exhaustive) provide “reasonable cause to suspect” and permit the opening of sealed letter class mail without a search warrant or authorization of the sender or addressee.</P>
            <P>1. A detector dog has alerted to the presence of narcotics or explosives in a specific mail article.</P>
            <P>2. X-ray of fluoroscope examination indicates the presence of merchandise or contraband.</P>
            <P>3. The weight, shape, feel, or sound of the mail article or its contents may indicate that merchandise or contraband (e.g., a hard object which may be jewelry, a stack of paper which may be counterfeit money, or coins) could be in the mail article. Contents of a mail article which feel lumpy, powdery, or spongy may, for example, indicate the presence of narcotics.</P>
            <P>4. Information from a source previously shown to be reliable indicates that an identifiable mail article contains merchandise or contraband.</P>
            <P>5. The mail article is insured.</P>
            <P>6. The mail article is a box, carton, or wrapper other than a thin envelope.</P>
            <P>7. The sender or addressee of the mail article is known to be fictitious.</P>
            <P>On the other hand, certain facts standing alone generally will not provide “reasonable cause to suspect” the presence of merchandise or contraband and therefore do not permit the opening of sealed letter class mail. For example, sealed letter class mail may not be opened merely because:</P>
            <P>1. The mail article is registered.</P>
            <P>2. The feel of a letter-size envelope suggests that it contains one or a limited number of photographs.</P>
            <P>3. The mail article appears to be part of a mass mailing.</P>
            <P>4. The mail article is from a particular country, whether or not a known source country of contraband.</P>
            <P>5. A detector dog has alerted to the presence of narcotics or explosives somewhere within a tray of mail (the individual articles of mail must then be examined individually).</P>
            <P>6. The sender of addressee of the mail article is known to have mailed or received contraband or merchandise in violation of law in the past.</P>

            <P>7. The wrapper contains writing or typing similar to that previously found on articles of mail which contained contraband or merchandise in violation of law.<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
            </P>
            <P>In case where any one of the above facts is present, additional evidence must exist which in conjunction with that fact provides reasonable cause to suspect the presence of merchandise or contraband.</P>

With Board approval (See 15 CFR part 400), that merchandise may be entered for consumption, for warehousing, for immediate transportation without appraisement, or under any other provision of the Customs laws, unless the Board has specified the form of entry to be made.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">For consumption.</E> If the return of zone-restricted merchandise to Customs territory for consumption has been ruled by the Board to be in the public interest, the entry shall be endorsed by the port director to show the authority under which it was made, and that the merchandise is subject to the provisions of Chapter 98, Subchapter I, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).</P>

The Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, shall be endorsed by the port director to show that the merchandise may not be withdrawn for consumption. In the case of zone-restricted merchandise transported in bond to another port for warehousing and exportation, Customs Form 7512 shall be endorsed by the port director to show that the merchandise is foreign trade zone merchandise in zone-restricted status, which shall be entered for warehouse with proper endorsement on Customs Form 7501, and which may not be withdrawn for consumption. <PRTPAGE P="121"/>Zone-restricted merchandise transferred from a zone to a Customs bonded warehouse may not be manipulated, except for packing or unpacking incidental to exportation.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided for in § 146.43, no merchandise will be transferred from a zone without a Customs permit on the appropriate entry or withdrawal form or other document as required in this part. This port director may authorize transfer from a zone without physical supervision or examination by a Customs officer. Upon issuance of a permit, the port director will authorize delivery of the merchandise only to the operator, who then may release the merchandise to the importer or carrier.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Liability for discrepancy.</E> When a transfer is not physically supervised by a Customs officer, the operator will be relieved of responsibility only for the merchandise in a zone in the condition and quantity as shown on the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate form. The operator will be relieved of responsibility only if it receives the signed receipt on the document of the importer or the carrier named in that document. The responsibility of the operator may be adjusted by any discrepancy report made jointly by the operator and the bonded cartman, lighterman, or carrier, or the importer, and signed by the above or an authorized representative within 15 days after transfer of the merchandise from the zone. Any adjustment must be noted on the permit copy of the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate form or document. A copy of any joint report of discrepancy must be submitted to the port director within 10 working days of signing by the parties.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time limit.</E> Except in the case of articles for use in a zone, merchandise for which a Customs permit for transfer to Customs territory has been issued must be physically removed from the zone within 5 working days of issuance of that permit. The port director, upon request of the operator, may extend that period for good cause. Merchandise awaiting removal within the required time limit will not be further manipulated or manufactured in the zone, but will be segregated or otherwise identified by the operator as merchandise that has been constructively transferred to Customs territory.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Retention or return of merchandise to zone for consumption.</E> (1) The port director shall cancel any entry for consumption where: (i) The merchandise is not removed from the zone within the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, or (ii) the merchandise was removed from the zone but did not enter the commerce of the U.S. in Customs territory and was subsequently readmitted to a zone in domestic status. If the port director has reason to believe any new entry would be cancelled under the provisions of this paragraph, he may reject the entry or demand a written stipulation, as a condition of entry acceptance, that the merchandise will not be returned to a zone in domestic status. Merchandise covered by an entry which has been cancelled under this paragraph shall be restored to its last foreign status.</P>

            <P>(2) A component of merchandise which has been entered, but not physically removed from a zone, shall be restored to its last zone status, provided the port director determines that the component was included in the entry through clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence not amounting to an error in the construction of the law. Such an error, including that in appraisement of any entry or liquidation due to the above circumstances, may be corrected pursuant to section 520(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended <PRTPAGE P="122"/>(19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1)), in accordance with the procedures described in part 173 of this chapter. If the port director decides there has been no error, mistake, or inadvertence, or that the information was not timely provided, the component will be considered as an overage and subject to the provisions of § 146.53(d).</P>
            <P>(3) When merchandise which has been entered for consumption is subsequently returned to a zone for a reason other than that specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, it shall be admitted in domestic status.</P>

Upon order of the Board the suspension may be continued. If appropriate, the suspension may be limited to an individual user or users and not to the zone or zone site as a whole, or may be limited to a particular activity of an operator or user, such as suspension of the privilege to admit merchandise or the privilege to manufacture. An action to suspend will be taken in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section if:</P>
            <P>(1) The approval of the application to activate the zone was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact;</P>
            <P>(2) The operator neglects or refuses to obey any proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or regulation relating to the operation or administration of a zone;</P>
            <P>(3) The operator, or any officer of a corporation which has been granted the right to operate a zone, is convicted of or has commited acts which would constitute a felony, or misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime. Any change in the employment status of the corporate officer (e.g., discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to conviction of a felony or prior to conviction of a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime, resulting from acts committed while a corporate officer, will not preclude application of this provision;</P>
            <P>(4) The operator fails to furnish a current list of names, addresses, or other information as required by § 146.7;</P>
            <P>(5) The operator does not provide a secure facility or properly safeguard merchandise within a zone;</P>
            <P>(6) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(7) The operator, or any officer, agent, or employee of the operator, discloses to an unauthorized person proprietary information contained on a Customs form or in the inventory control and recordkeeping system; or</P>
            <P>(8) The inventory control and recordkeeping system is impaired to the point where the identity of merchandise in zone status has been lost and cannot be reestablished without a suspension of zone operations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice.</E> The port director may, at any time, serve notice, in writing, upon an operator to show cause why its right to continue operation of a zone should not be suspended or why an individual user or activities <PRTPAGE P="123"/>of an individual user should not be suspended, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section. The notice will advise the operator of the grounds for the proposed action and will afford the operator an opportunity to respond, in writing, within 15 days after receipt of the notice. Thereafter, the port director shall consider the allegations and any response made by the operator and issue a decision, unless the operator requests a hearing in the matter.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Hearing.</E> If the operator requests a hearing, it will be held before a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner of Customs or his designee within 30 days following the operator's request. The operator may be represented by counsel at the hearing, and any evidence and testimony of witnesses in the proceeding, including substantiation of the allegations and the response thereto, will be presented. The right of cross-examination will be available to both parties. A stenographic record of the proceeding will be made and a copy will be delivered to the operator. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit promptly all papers and the stenographic record of the hearing to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, together with a recommendation for final action.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Decision of Assistant Commissioner.</E> Within 10 calendar days after delivery to the operator of a copy of the stenographic record of the hearing, the operator may submit to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, in writing any additional views or arguments. The Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, shall then render a written decision stating his reasons therefor. That decision will be served on the operator and will be considered the final Customs administrative action in the case.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Grantee.</E> If the grantee of the zone is not the operator, a copy of the notice to show cause will be served upon the grantee. The grantee, as a party-in-interest, may join the operator in any proceedings under this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Inventory control and recordkeeping system.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Attribution.</E> All final products removed from or consumed within a petroleum refinery subzone must be attributed to feedstock admitted into said petroleum refinery subzone in the current or prior manufacturing period. Attribution must be based on records maintained by the operator. Attribution may be made by applying one of the authorized methods set forth in this section. Records must be maintained on a weight or volume basis.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Producibility.</E> The producibility method of attribution requires that records be kept to attribute final products to feedstocks which are eligible for attribution as set forth in this section during the current or prior manufacturing period.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Actual production records.</E> An operator may use its actual production records as provided for under § 146.95(b) of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other inventory method.</E> An operator may use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method of accounting (see § 191.22(c) of this chapter). The use of this method is illustrated in the appendix to this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Feedstock eligible for attribution.</E> Only a feedstock that has been admitted into the refinery subzone is eligible for attribution. For a given manufacturing period, the quantity of feedstock eligible for attribution may be computed as beginning inventory, plus receipts less shipments of feedstock out of the subzone, and less ending inventory.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consumption or removal of final product.</E> Each final product that is consumed in or removed from a refinery subzone must be attributed to a feedstock eligible for attribution during the current or a prior manufacturing period. Each final product attributed as being produced from the separation of a privileged foreign status feedstock must be assigned the proper relative <PRTPAGE P="125"/>value as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Relative value.</E> A relative value calculation is required when two or more final products are produced as the result of the separation of privileged foreign status feedstock. Ad valorem and compound rates of duty must be converted to specific rates of duty in order to make a relative value calculation.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Privileged status after admission.</E> Nonprivileged status feedstock is eligible for privileged status only if the request shows to the satisfaction of the Customs Service that there was no manipulation or manufacture of the feedstock to change its tariff classification before the request is granted. The absence of such manipulation or manufacture can be shown by demonstrating that the feedstock was placed in an empty tank, in a tank that contained only feedstock with the same nominal specifications or providing a sample which shows there was no change in tariff status. The existence of negligible amounts of other feedstocks may be disregarded only in accordance with § 146.95(b). A request for after-admission privileged foreign status shall be denied unless the feedstock's tank records from admission to the time that the request is made accompany the request. A refiner who makes such a request shall not put any other feedstock having different nominal specifications into the tank until the request for privileged status is granted. The Customs Service will deny or revoke a post-admission request if a refiner fails to retain the integrity of the feedstock in the tank.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Consistent use required.</E> The operator must use the selected method, measurement (weight or volume), and the price of product consistently (see § 146.92(g) of this subpart and paragraph (a) of this section).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Records concerning establishment of manufacturing period.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Feedstock admitted into the refinery subzone.</E> The operator must maintain appropriate inventory records during the manufacturing period to substantiate the feedstock(s) eligible for attribution under § 146.93(b) and in accordance with the operator's selected attribution method.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Final product consumed in or removed from subzone.</E> The operator must record the date and amount of each final product consumed in, or removed from the subzone.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consumption or removal.</E> The consumption or removal of a final product during a week may be considered to have occurred on the last day of that week for purposes of attribution and relative value calculation instead of the actual day on which the removal or consumption occurred, unless the refiner elects to attribute using the FIFO method (see section II of the appendix to this part).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Gain or loss.</E> A gain or loss that occurs during a manufacturing period must be taken into account in determining the attribution of a final product to a feedstock and the relative value calculation of privileged foreign feedstocks. Any gain in a final product attributed to a non-privileged foreign status feedstock is dutiable if entered for consumption unless otherwise exempt from duty.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Determining gain or loss; acceptable methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">Converting volume to weight.</E> Volume measurements may be converted to weight measurements using American Petroleum Institute conversion factors to account for gain or loss.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Calculating feedstock factor to account for volume gain or loss.</E> A feedstock factor may be calculated by dividing the value per barrel of production per product category by the quotient of the total value of production divided by all feedstock consumed. This factor would be applied to a finished product that has been attributed to a feedstock to account for volume gain.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Calculating volume difference.</E> Volume difference may be determined by comparing the amount of feedstocks introduced for a given period with the amount of final products produced during the period, and then assigning the volume change to each final product proportionately.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Methods of attribution.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Producibility</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A subzone operator must attribute the <PRTPAGE P="126"/>source of each final product. The operator is limited in this regard to feedstocks which were eligible for attribution during the current or prior manufacturing period. Attribution of final products is allowable to the extent that the quantity of such products could have been produced from such feedstocks, using the industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis, as published in T.D. 66-16. Once attribution is made for a particular product, that attribution is binding. Subsequent attributions of feedstock to product must take prior attributions into account. Each refiner shall keep records showing each attribution.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Industry standards of potential production.</E> The industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis necessary for the producibility attribution method are contained in tables published in T.D. 66-16. With these tables, a subzone operator may attribute final products consumed in, or removed from, the subzone to feedstocks during the current or a prior manufacturing period.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Attribution to product or feedstock not listed in T.D. 66-16.</E> (i) For purposes of attribution, where a final product or a feedstock is not listed in T.D. 66-16, the operator must submit a proposed attribution schedule, supported by a technical memorandum, to the appropriate port director. The port director shall refer the request to the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit (“ORA”), who will verify the refiner's records and will coordinate with the Director, Office of Laboratories and Scientific Services (“OLSS”). The Director, ORA, shall either approve or deny the request. If the request is approved, the Director, ORA, shall publish a modification of T.D. 66-16. If an operator elects to show attribution on a producibility basis, but fails to keep records on that basis, the operator shall use its actual operating records to determine attribution and any necessary relative value calculation upon the Customs Service demand and subject to verification.</P>
            <P>(ii) An operator may attribute a final product to a feedstock in excess of the amount allowed under T.D. 66-16, when authorized by Customs, without losing the ability to attribute under T.D. 66-16 for all other feedstock-final product combinations. The operator must use its actual production records for the requested feedstock-final product combination. The operator must agree in writing that it will not, and it will not enable any other person, to file a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313 inconsistent with those actual production records for that feedstock-final product combination. The operator shall file its request in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The Director, ORA, and the Director, OLSS, must determine whether T.D. 66-16 needs to be modified and shall publish in the Customs Bulletin each approval granted under this paragraph and request public comments with each such approval.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Attribution to privileged foreign feedstock; relative value.</E> If a final product is attributed to the separation of a privileged foreign feedstock a relative value must be assigned (see section IV of the appendix to this part).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Refinery operating records.</E> An operator may use the actual refinery operating records to attribute the feedstocks used to the removed or consumed products. Customs shall accept the operator's operating conventions to the extent that the operator demonstrates that it actually uses these conventions in its refinery operations. Whatever conventions are elected by the operator, they must be used consistently in order to be acceptable to Customs. Additionally, Customs may use these records to test the validity of admissions into the subzone, consumption within and removals from the subzone.

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>If the operator mixes three equal quantities of material in a day tank and treats that product as a three-part mixture in its production unit, Customs will accept the resulting product as composed of the three materials. If, in the alternative, the operator assumes that the three products do not mix and treats the first product as being composed of the first material put into the day tank, the second product as composed of the second material put into the day tank, and the third product as being composed of the third material put into the day tank, Customs will accept that convention also.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval procedure.</E> An operator must seek prior approval of another recordkeeping procedure by submitting the following to the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit:</P>
            <P>(1) An explanation of the method describing how attribution will be made when a finished product is removed from or consumed in the subzone, and how and when the feedstocks will be decremented;</P>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">50,000 pounds PF class III crude oil.</FP>

            <P>Removal from the refinery subzone for exportation of 50,000 pounds of aviation gasoline.</P>
            <P>The period of manufacture for the aviation gasoline is Day 1 to Day 10. The refiner must first attribute the designated source of the aviation gasoline.</P>
            <P>In order to maximize the duty benefit conferred by the zone operation, the refiner chooses to attribute the exported aviation gasoline to the privileged foreign status crude oil. Under the tables for potential production (T.V. 66-16), class II crude has a 30% potential, and class III has a 40% potential. The maximum aviation gasoline producible from the class II crude oil is 15,000 pounds (50,000 × .30). The maximum aviation gasoline producible from the privileged foreign status class III crude oil is 20,000 pounds (50,000 × .40). The domestic class III crude would also make 20,000 pounds of aviation gasoline.</P>
            <P>The refiner could attribute 15,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class II crude oil, 20,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class III crude oil, and 15,000 pounds of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the 50,000 pounds of the aviation gasoline that was exported; 35,000 pounds of class II crude oil would be available for further production for other than aviation gasoline, 30,000 pounds of privileged foreign class III crude oil would be available for further production for other than aviation gasoline, and 35,000 pounds of domestic status class III crude oil would be available for further production, of which up to 5,000 pounds could be attributed to aviation gasoline.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Day 21</HD>
            <P>Receipt in the refinery subzone:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">50,000 pounds PF status class I crude oil.</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">50,000 pounds PF status class IV crude oil.</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Day 30</HD>
            <P>Removal from the refinery subzone:</P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">30,000 pounds of motor gasoline for consumption.</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">10,000 pounds of jet fuel sold to the US Air Force for use in military aircraft.</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline sold to a U.S. commuter airline for domestic flights.</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">10,000 pounds of kerosene for exportation.</FP>
            

            <P>To the extent that the crude oils that entered production on Day 1 are attributed as the designated sources for the products removed on Day 30, the period of manufacture is Day 1 to Day 30. If the refiner chooses to attribute the crude oils that were admitted on Day 21 as the designated sources of the <PRTPAGE P="128"/>products removed on Day 30 using the production standards published in T.D. 66-16, the manufacturing period is Day 21 to Day 30. This choice will be important if a relative value calculation on the privileged foreign status crude oil is required, because the law requires the value used for computing the relative value to be the average per unit value of each product for the manufacturing period. Relative value must be calculated if a source feedstock is separated into two or more products that are removed from the subzone refinery. If the average per unit value for each product differs between the manufacturing period from Day 1 to Day 30 and the manufacturing period from Day 21 to Day 30, the correct period must be used in the calculation.</P>
            <P>In order to minimize duty liability, the refiner would try to attribute the production of the exported kerosene and the sale of the jet fuel to the US Air Force to the privileged foreign crude oils. For the same reason, the refiner would try to attribute the removed motor gasoline and the aviation gasoline for the commuter airline to the domestic crude oil.</P>
            <P>Accordingly, the refiner chooses to attribute up to 5,000 pounds of the domestic status class III crude as the source of the 10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline removed from the subzone refinery for the commuter airline. Since no other aviation gasoline could have been produced from the crude oils that were admitted into the refinery subzone Day 1, the refiner must attribute the remainder to the crude oils that entered production on Day 21. Again, using the production standards from T.D. 66-16, the class I crude could produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 10,000 pounds (50,000 × .20). Likewise, the class IV crude oil could produce aviation gasoline in an amount up to 8,500 pounds (50,000 × .17).</P>
            <P>The refiner selects use of the class I crude as the source of the aviation gasoline. The refiner could attribute up to 27,300 pounds (35,000−5,000 × .91) of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the motor gasoline. This would leave 2,700 pounds of domestic class III crude available for further production for other than aviation gasoline or motor gasoline. The remaining motor gasoline removed (also 2,700 pounds) must be attributed to a privileged foreign crude oil. The refiner selects the privileged foreign class II crude oil that entered production on Day 1 as the source for the remaining 2,700 pounds of motor gasoline.</P>
            <P>This would leave 32,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for further production, of which no more than 27,400 pounds could be designated as the source of motor gasoline. The refiner attributes the jet fuel that is removed from the refinery subzone for the US Air Force for use in military aircraft to the privileged foreign class II crude oil. The refiner could attribute up to 20,995 pounds of jet fuel from that class II crude oil (32,300 × .65). Designating that class II crude oil as the source of the 10,000 pounds of jet fuel leaves 22,300 pounds of privileged foreign class II crude oil available for further production, of which up to 10,995 pounds could be attributed as the source of the jet fuel. Because the motor gasoline and the jet fuel, under the foregoing attribution, would be considered to have been separated from the privileged foreign class II crude oil, a relative value calculation would be required.</P>
            <P>The jet fuel is eligible for removal from the subzone free of duty by virtue of 19 U.S.C. 1309(a)(1)(A). The refiner could attribute the privileged foreign class II crude oil as being the source of the 10,000 pounds of jet fuel (22,300 × .65). The refiner chooses to attribute the privileged foreign class III crude oil as the source of the jet fuel. The refiner could attribute to that class III crude oil up to 15,000 pounds of kerosene (30,000 × .50).</P>

          <P>This part contains the regulations governing the allowance of exemptions for residents and nonresidents arriving in the United States, for crewmembers of carriers engaged in international traffic, for military and civilian employees of the United States, for certain evacuees, and for certain personnel of foreign governments and international organizations. Procedures and requirements are also set forth pertaining to registration of articles to be taken abroad, declaration <PRTPAGE P="142"/>and entry, and examination of baggage, and collection of duties and taxes.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Registration of effects to be taken abroad.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Persons who may use procedure.</E> Any person, except a nonresident seaman, airman, or person engaged in similar employment, who intends to take effects of foreign origin abroad may register such articles before departure from the United States in order to facilitate their identification on return to the United States. Only articles of foreign origin having serial numbers or other distinctive, permanently affixed unique markings can be registered.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures for registration.</E> Applicants for registration of articles of foreign origin shall present the articles, together with a completed, but unsigned, Customs Form 4457, or its electronic equivalent, which may be obtained in advance of departure, to a Customs officer. After the Customs officer has examined the articles and verified their description, he shall have the applicant sign the form. The Customs officer shall then sign the form and return it to the applicant for presentation on return of the articles. Customs form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, may be required in any case in which Customs form 4457, or its electronic equivalent, will not adequately serve the purpose of registration.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Presentation on return and reuse.</E> The form shall be presented to the Customs officer when the registered articles are returned to the United States. The form shall be valid for reuse as long as the document is legible to identify the registered articles.</P>

            <P>(1) Residents of the United States returning from abroad, and</P>
            <P>(2) All other persons, hereinafter referred to as nonresidents.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Status as returning resident.</E> Citizens of the United States, or persons who have formerly resided in the United States, (including American citizens who are residents of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States) will be deemed residents of the United States returning from abroad within the meaning of “residents” as used in Chapter 98, Subchapter IV, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), in the absence of satisfactory evidence that they have established a home elsewhere. The residence of a minor child will be presumed to be the residence of the child's parents.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Status as nonresident.</E> Any person arriving in the United States who is not a resident of the United States or who, though a resident of the United States, is not returning from abroad, will be treated for the purpose of these regulations as a nonresident.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional claim of nonresident status.</E> Any person arriving in the United States who would otherwise be considered a returning resident, may claim at his option the status of a nonresident if he intends to remain in the United States for only a short period of time before returning abroad. If the status as a nonresident claimed by an arriving person is allowed, the procedures in § 148.8 will be followed.</P>

However, an oral declaration may be accepted in lieu of a written declaration on Customs Form 3299, for effects of a resident which are free of duty under subheadings 9804.00.10 or 9804.00.45.

Such exemption from entry may also be applied with respect to household effects or tools of trade entitled to free entry (see §§ 148.52 and 148.53 respectively) which are unaccompanied or forwarded in bond.</P>

The exemption of a family member who has not attained the age of 21 will not be applied under the group exemption to alcoholic beverages. No exemptions allowable to individuals employed by the household and accompanying the family but not related by blood, marriage, domestic relationship, or adoption will be included in the family grouping.</P>

In such a case, CBP Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, will be issued to the importer at the time the determination of nonimportation is made and the duplicate replacement will be considered to have been acquired abroad for the purposes of the $800 or $1,600 exemption provision, provided no charge is made to the importer for the duplicate replacement.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemption.</E> Furniture, carpets, paintings, tableware, books, libraries, and other usual household furnishings and effects actually used abroad for not less than 1 year by resident or nonresidents, and not intended for any other person or for sale may be allowed entry free of duty and tax under subheading 9804.00.05, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202). Household effects used abroad not less than 1 year by a family of which the importer was a resident member for not less than 1 year during <PRTPAGE P="156"/>the period of use may be allowed free entry whether or not the importer owned the effects at the time of such use. The year of use need not be continuous, nor need it immediately precede the time of importation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Proof of use.</E> In order to obtain free entry for household effects under this section, the use of the effects abroad for 1 year must be proven to the satisfaction of the port director. The port director, in his discretion, may require evidence of use other than the declaration provided for in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Declaration.</E> When household effects are claimed to be free of duty a declaration of the owner on Customs Form 3299, or its electronic equivalent, shall be required to support the claim for free entry. If it is impracticable to produce the declaration at the time of entry, the importer may give a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter, for the production of the owner's declaration within 6 months.</P>

            <P>Each person, including a crewmember, arriving in the United States who enters articles for his personal or household use, or as bona fide gifts not imported for sale nor for the account of another person, valued in the aggregate at not over $1,000 fair retail value in the country of acquisition, shall be assessed a flat rate of duty on the articles, as provided in § 148.102. The entry shall be made under subheading 9816.00.20 or 9816.00.40, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), and is subject to the limitations and conditions in this subpart. Except as provided in § 148.105, the flat rate of duty shall be assessed in place of any rates of duty other than free rates of duty. If the dutiable amount of the article(s) is over $1,000 fair retail value, the flat rate of duty provisions shall apply to the amount not over $1,000 fair retail value, and the excess amount shall be valued under section 402, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a). The article(s) shall be classified under the appropriate subheading number of the tariff schedule. For purposes of this subpart, “fair retail value” in the country of acquisition means the price at which the merchandise is freely offered there for sale at retail and “country of acquisition” includes America Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.</P>

            <P>The provisions of this subpart are applicable to articles not accompanying a person, including a crewmember, which are purchased in <E T="03">and</E> shipped from American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States. However, this subpart is not applicable to the importation of unaccompanied articles in a manner prohibited by law or regulation (e.g., mail shipments of alcoholic beverages or alcoholic beverages shipped other than by mail in excess of quantities authorized by State laws or regulations).</P>
            <P>The following is a summary of the procedure to be followed to obtain the benefits of this subpart: A person purchasing articles in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States would receive a sales slip, invoice, or other evidence of purchase which he would present to the Customs officer along with his baggage declaration, Customs Form 6059-B, and a Declaration of Unaccompanied Articles, Customs Form 255. The latter form is prepared in triplicate for each shipment to follow. The Customs officer would verify the information, indicate on the form whether the article or articles were free of duty, dutiable at the flat rate, or a combination of the foregoing, and validate the form. Two copies would be returned to the traveler, who would send one form to the vendor. Upon receipt of the form the vendor would place it in an envelope, affix it to the outside of the package, clearly mark the package “Unaccompanied Tourist Shipment,” and send the package to the traveler, generally via mail, although it could be sent by other means. If sent through the mail, the package would be examined by Customs and forwarded to the Postal Service for delivery. Any duties due would be collected by the mailman. If the shipment arrives other than through the mail, the traveler would be notified by the carrier when the article arrives. Entry would be made by the carrier or the traveler at the customhouse. Any duties due would be collected at that time.</P>

            <P>(h) <E T="03">What are the accreditation/reaccreditation fee requirements?</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A fixed fee, representing Customs administrative overhead expense, will be assessed for each application for accreditation or reaccreditation. In addition, associated assessments, representing the actual costs associated with travel and per diem of Customs employees related to verification of application criteria and background investigations will be charged. The combination of the fixed fee and associated <PRTPAGE P="188"/>assessments represent reimbursement to Customs for costs related to accreditation and reaccreditation. The fixed fee will be published in the Customs Bulletin and the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Based on a review of the actual costs associated with the program, the fixed fee may be adjusted periodically; any changes will be published in the Customs Bulletin and the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Accreditation fees.</E> A nonrefundable pre-payment equal to 50 percent of the fixed accreditation fee to cover preliminary processing costs must accompany each application for accreditation. Before a laboratory will be accredited, it must remit to Customs, at the address specified in the billing, within the 30 day billing period, the associated charges assessed for the accreditation and the balance of the fixed accreditation fee.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reaccreditation fees.</E> Before a laboratory will be reaccredited, it must submit to Customs, at the billing address specified, within the 30 day billing period the fixed reaccreditation fee.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Disputes.</E> In the event a laboratory disputes the charges assessed for travel and per diem costs associated with scheduled inspection visits, it may file an appeal within 30 calendar days of the date of the assessment with the Executive Director. The appeal letter must specify which charges are in dispute and provide such supporting documentation as may be available for each allegation. The Executive Director will make findings of fact concerning the merits of an appeal and communicate the agency decision to the laboratory in writing within 30 calendar days of the date of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Can existing Customs-accredited laboratories continue to operate?</E> Commercial laboratories accredited by the Executive Director prior to December 8, 1993, will retain that accreditation under these regulations provided they conduct their business in a manner consistent with the administrative portions of this section. This paragraph does not pertain to any laboratory which has had its accreditation suspended or revoked. Laboratories which have had their accreditations continued under this section will have their status reevaluated on their next triennial inspection date which is no earlier than three years after the effective date of this regulation. At the time of reaccreditation, these laboratories must meet the requirements of this section and remit to Customs, at the address specified in the billing, within the 30 day billing period, the fixed reaccreditation fee. Failure to meet these requirements will result in revocation or suspension of the accreditation.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">How will Customs-accredited laboratories operate?</E>—(1) <E T="03">Samples for testing.</E> Upon request by the importer of record of merchandise, the port director will release a representative sample of the merchandise for testing by a Customs-accredited laboratory at the expense of the importer. Under Customs supervision, the sample will be split into two essentially equal parts and given to the Customs-accredited laboratory. One portion of the sample may be used by the Customs-accredited laboratory for its testing. The other portion must be retained by the laboratory, under appropriate storage conditions, for Customs use, as necessary, unless Customs requires other specific procedures. Upon request, the sample portion reserved for Customs purposes must be surrendered to Customs.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Retention of non-perishable samples.</E> Non-perishable samples reserved for Customs and sample remnants from any testing must be retained by the accredited laboratory for a period of four months from the date of the laboratory's final analysis report, unless other instructions are issued in writing by Customs. At the end of this retention time period, the accredited laboratory may dispose of the retained samples and sample remnants in a manner consistent with federal, state, and local statutes.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Retention of perishable samples.</E> Perishable samples reserved for Customs and sample remnants from any testing can be disposed of more expeditiously than provided for at paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, if done in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures, unless other instructions are issued in writing by Customs.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Reports</E>—(i) <E T="03">Contents of reports.</E> Testing data must be obtained using <PRTPAGE P="189"/>methods approved by the Executive Director. The testing results from a Customs-accredited laboratory that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry, in the absence of testing conducted by Customs laboratories, will be accepted by Customs, provided that the importer of record certifies that the sample tested was taken from the merchandise in the entry and the report establishes elements relating to the admissibility, quantity, composition, or characteristics of the merchandise entered, as required by law.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Status of commercial reports where Customs also tests merchandise.</E> Nothing in these regulations will preclude Customs from sampling and testing merchandise from a shipment which has been sampled and tested by a Customs-accredited laboratory at the request of an importer. In cases where a shipment has been analyzed by both Customs and a Customs-accredited laboratory, all Customs actions will be based upon the analysis provided by the Customs laboratory, unless the Executive Director advises otherwise. If Customs tests merchandise, it will release the results of its test to the importer of record or its agent upon request unless the testing information is proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent, or developed by Customs for enforcement purposes.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> Customs-accredited laboratories must maintain records of the type normally kept in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable provision of law, and make them available during normal business hours for Customs inspection. In addition, these laboratories must maintain all records necessary to permit the evaluation and verification of all Customs-related work, including, as appropriate, those described below. All records must be maintained for five years, unless the laboratory is notified in writing by Customs that a longer retention time is necessary for particular records. Electronic data storage and transmission may be approved by Customs.</P>

            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Records of analytical procedures.</E> The Customs-accredited laboratory must maintain complete and up-to-date copies of all approved analytical procedures, calibration methods, etc., and must document the procedures each staff member is authorized to perform. These procedures must be readily available to appropriate staff.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Laboratory analysis records.</E> The Customs-accredited laboratory must identify each analysis by sample record number (see paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section) and must maintain all information or data (such as sample weights, temperatures, references to filed spectra, etc.) associated with each Customs-related laboratory analysis. Each analysis record must be dated and initialed or signed by the staff member(s) who did the work.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Laboratory analysis reports.</E> Each laboratory analysis report submitted to Customs must include:</P>
            <P>(A) The name and address of the Customs-accredited laboratory;</P>

            <P>(B) A description and identification of the sample, including its unique identifying number;<PRTPAGE P="190"/>
            </P>
            <P>(C) The designations of each analysis procedure used;</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Representation of Customs-accredited status.</E> Commercial laboratories accredited by Customs must limit statements or wording regarding their accreditation to an accurate description of the tests for the commodity group(s) for which accreditation has been obtained. Use of terms other than those appearing in the notice of accreditation (see paragraph (g) of this section) is prohibited.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Subcontracting prohibited.</E> Customs-accredited laboratories must not subcontract Customs-related analysis work to non Customs-accredited laboratories or non Customs-approved gaugers, but may subcontract to other facilities that are Customs-accredited/approved and in good standing.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">How can a laboratory have its accreditation suspended or revoked or be required to pay a monetary penalty?</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grounds for suspension, revocation, or assessment of a monetary penalty</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Executive Director may immediately suspend or revoke a laboratory's accreditation only in cases where the laboratory's actions are intentional violations of any Customs law or when required by public health or safety. In other situations where the Executive Director has cause, the Executive Director will propose the suspension or revocation of a laboratory's accreditation or propose a monetary penalty and provide the laboratory with the opportunity to respond to the notice of proposed action.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Specific grounds.</E> A laboratory's accreditation may be suspended or revoked, or a monetary penalty may be assessed because:</P>
            <P>(A) The selection was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact by the laboratory;</P>

            <P>(2) To have no interest in or other connection with any business or other activity which might affect the unbiased performance of duties as a Customs-approved gauger. It is understood that this does not prohibit acceptance of the usual fees for professional services;</P>
            <P>(3) To maintain the ability, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the instrumentation, equipment, qualified staff, facilities, etc., to perform the services for which the gauger is approved, and allow the Executive Director to evaluate that ability on a periodic basis by such means as on-site inspections, demonstrations of gauging procedures, and reviews of submitted records;</P>
            <P>(4) To retain those gauger records beyond the five-year record-retention period specified by Customs as necessary to address matters concerned in pending litigation, and, if gauger operations or approval cease, to contact Customs immediately regarding the disposition of records retained;</P>
            <P>(5) To promptly investigate any circumstance which might affect the accuracy of work performed as an approved gauger, to correct the situation immediately, and to notify the port director, the Executive Director, and the Center director of such matters, their consequences, and any corrective action taken or that needs to be taken; and</P>
            <P>(6) To immediately notify the port director, the Executive Director, and the Center director of any attempt to impede, influence, or coerce gauger personnel in the performance of their duties, or of any decision to terminate gauger operations or approval status. Further, within 5 days of any changes involving legal name, address, ownership, parent-subsidiary relationships, bond, other offices or sites, or approved signatories to notify the Executive Director by certified mail.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">What are the approved measurement procedures?</E> Customs-approved gaugers must comply with appropriate procedures published by such professional organizations as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the American Petroleum Institute (API), unless the Executive Director gives written permission to use an alternate method. Alternative methods will be considered and approved on a case-by-case basis.<PRTPAGE P="193"/>

(Final approval determinations will not be made until the applicant has satisfied all bond requirements and <PRTPAGE P="194"/>made payment on all assessed charges and the balance of the applicable approval fee). All final notices of approval, reapproval, or extension of existing Customs approval will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and Customs Bulletin.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Grounds for nonselection.</E> The Executive Director may deny a gauger's application for any of the following reasons:</P>
            <P>(i) The application contains false or misleading information concerning a material fact;</P>
            <P>(ii) The gauger, a principal of the gauging facility, or a person the Executive Director determines is exercising substantial ownership or control over the gauger operation is indicted for, convicted of, or has committed acts which would:</P>

            <P>(B) Reflect adversely on the business integrity of the applicant;</P>
            <P>(iii) A determination is made that the gauger-applicant does not possess the technical capability, have adequate facilities, or management to perform the approved methods of measurement for Customs purposes;</P>
            <P>(iv) A determination is made that the gauger has submitted false reports or statements concerning the measurement of merchandise, or that the applicant was subject to sanctions by state, local, or professional administrative bodies for such conduct;</P>
            <P>(v) Nonpayment of assessed charges and the balance of the fixed approval fee; or</P>
            <P>(vi) Failure to execute a bond in accordance with part 113 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Adverse approval decisions; appeal procedures.</E> (i) <E T="03">Preliminary notice.</E> A gauger which is not selected for approval will be sent a preliminary notice of nonselection. The preliminary notice of nonselection will state the specific grounds for the proposed nonselection decision and advise the gauger that it may file a response addressing the grounds for the action proposed with the Executive Director within 30 calendar days of the date the preliminary notice of nonselection was received by the gauger.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Final notice</E>—(A) <E T="03">Based on nonresponse.</E> If the gauger does not respond to the preliminary notice, the Executive Director will issue a final notice of nonselection within 60 calendar days of the date the preliminary notice of nonselection was received by the gauger applicant. The final notice of nonselection will state the specific grounds for the nonselection and advise the gauger that it may choose to pursue one of the following two options:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Submit a new application for approval, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 180 days after the date of the final notice of nonselection; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Administratively appeal the final notice of nonselection to the Assistant Commissioner within 30 calendar days of the date of the final notice of nonselection.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Based on response.</E> If the gauger files a timely response, the Executive Director will issue a final determination regarding the gauger's approval within 30 calendar days of the date the applicant's response is received by the Executive Director. If this final determination is adverse to the gauger, then the final notice of nonselection will state the specific grounds for nonselection and advise the gauger that it may choose to pursue one of the two options provided at paragraphs (e)(3)(ii)(A)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Appeal decision.</E> The Assistant Commissioner will issue a decision on the appeal within 30 calendar days of the date the appeal is received. If the appeal decision is adverse to the gauger, then the decision notice will advise the gauger that it may choose to pursue one of the following two options:</P>
            <P>(A) Submit a new application for approval, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 120 days after the date of the appeal decision; or</P>
            <P>(B) File an action with the Court of International Trade, pursuant to chapter 169 of title 28, United States Code, within 60 days of the date of the appeal decision.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">What are the approval/reapproval fee requirements?</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A fixed fee, representing Customs administrative overhead expense, will be assessed <PRTPAGE P="195"/>for each application for approval or reapproval. In addition, associated assessments, representing the actual costs associated with travel and per diem of Customs employees related to verification of application criteria and background investigations will be charged. The combination of the fixed fee and associated assessments represent reimbursement to Customs for costs related to approval and reapproval. The fixed fee will be published in the Customs Bulletin and the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Based on a review of the actual costs associated with the program, the fixed fee may be adjusted periodically; any changes will be published in the Customs Bulletin and the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Approval fees.</E> A nonrefundable pre-payment equal to 50 percent of the fixed approval fee to cover preliminary processing costs must accompany each application for approval. Before a gauger will be approved, it must submit to Customs, at the address specified in the billing, within the 30 day billing period the associated charges assessed for the approval and the balance of the fixed approval fee.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reapproval fees.</E> Before a gauger will be reapproved, it must submit to Customs, at the billing address specified, within the 30 day billing period, the fixed reapproval fee.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Disputes.</E> In the event a gauger disputes the charges assessed for travel and per diem costs associated with scheduled inspection visits, it may file an appeal within 30 calendar days of the date of the assessment with the Executive Director. The appeal letter must specify which charges are in dispute and provide such supporting documentation as may be available for each allegation. The Executive Director will make findings of fact concerning the merits of an appeal and communicate the agency decision to the gauger in writing within 30 calendar days of the date of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Can existing Customs-approved gaugers continue to operate?</E> Commercial gaugers approved by the Executive Director prior to December 8, 1993, will retain approval under these regulations provided that they conduct their business in a manner consistent with the administrative portions of this section. This paragraph does not pertain to any gauger which has had its approval suspended or revoked. Gaugers which have had their approvals continued under this section will have their status reevaluated on their next triennial inspection date which is no earlier than three years after the effective date of this regulation. At the time of reapproval, these gaugers must meet the requirements of this section and remit to Customs, at the address specified in the billing, within the 30 day billing period the fixed reapproval fee. Failure to meet these requirements will result in revocation or suspension of the approval.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">How will Customs-approved gaugers operate?</E>—(1) <E T="03">Reports</E>—(i) <E T="03">Contents of reports.</E> The measurement results from a Customs-approved gauger that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry, in the absence of measurements conducted by Customs, will be accepted by Customs, provided that the importer of record certifies that the measurement was of the merchandise in the entry. All reports must measure net landed quantity, except in the case of crude petroleum of Heading 2709, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), which may be measured by gross quantity. Reports must use the appropriate HTSUS units of quantity, e.g., liters, barrels, or kilograms.</P>

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Status of commercial reports where Customs also gauges merchandise.</E> Nothing in these regulations will preclude Customs from gauging a shipment which has been gauged by a Customs-approved gauger at the request of an importer. In cases where a shipment has been gauged by both Customs and a Customs-approved gauger, all Customs actions will be based upon the gauging reports issued by Customs, unless the Executive Director advises other actions. If Customs gauges merchandise, it will release the report of its measurements to the importer of record or its agent upon request unless the gauging information is proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent, or developed by Customs for enforcement purposes.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> Customs-approved gaugers must maintain records of the type normally kept in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable provisions of law, and make them available during normal business hours for Customs inspection. In addition, these gaugers must maintain all records necessary to permit the evaluation and verification of all Customs-related work, including, as appropriate, those described below. All records must be maintained for five years, unless the gauger is notified in writing by Customs that a longer retention time is necessary for particular records. Electronic data storage and transmission may be approved by Customs.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Transaction records.</E> Records for each Customs-related transaction must be readily accessible and have the following:</P>
            <P>(A) A unique identifying number;</P>

            <P>(C) The identity of the product (e.g., crude oil);</P>
            <P>(D) The name of the client;</P>
            <P>(E) The source of the product (e.g., name of vessel, flight number of airline); and</P>
            <P>(F) If available, the Customs entry date, entry number, and port of entry and the names of the importer, exporter, manufacturer, and country-of-origin.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Major equipment records.</E> Records for each major piece of equipment used in Customs-related work must identify the name and type of instrument, the manufacturer's name, the instrument's model and any serial numbers, and the occurrence of all servicing performed on the equipment or instrument, to include recalibration and any repair work, identifying who performed the service and when.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Records of gauging procedures.</E> The Customs-approved gauger must maintain complete and up-to-date copies of all approved gauging procedures, calibration methods, etc., and must document the procedures that each staff member is authorized to perform. These procedures must be readily available to appropriate staff.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Gauging records.</E> The Customs-approved gauger must identify each transaction by transaction record number (see paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section) and must maintain all information or data (such as temperatures, etc.) associated with each Customs-related gauging transaction. Each gauging record (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the complete file of all data for each separate transaction) must be dated and initialed or signed by the staff member(s) who did the work.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Gauging reports.</E> Each gauging report submitted to Customs must include:</P>
            <P>(A) The name and address of the Customs-approved gauger;</P>
            <P>(B) A description and identification of the transaction, including its unique identifying number;</P>
            <P>(C) The designations of each gauging procedure used;</P>
            <P>(D) The gauging report itself (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the quantity of the merchandise);</P>
            <P>(E) The date of the report; and</P>

            <P>(F) The typed name and signature of the person accepting technical responsibility for the gauging report (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> an approved signatory).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Representation of Customs-approved status.</E> Commercial gaugers approved by Customs must limit statements or wording regarding their approval to an accurate description of the commodities for which approval has been obtained. Use of terms other than those appearing in the notice of approval (see <PRTPAGE P="197"/>paragraph (e) of this section) is prohibited.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Subcontracting prohibited.</E> Customs-approved gaugers must not subcontract Customs-related work to non Customs-approved gaugers or non Customs-accredited laboratories, but may subcontract to other facilities that are Customs-approved/accredited and in good standing.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">How can a gauger have its approval suspended or revoked or be required to pay a monetary penalty?</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grounds for suspension, revocation, or assessment of a monetary penalty</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Executive Director may immediately suspend or revoke a gauger's approval only in cases where the gauger's actions are intentional violations of any Customs law or when required by public health or safety. In other situations where the Executive Director has cause, the Executive Director will propose the suspension or revocation of a gauger's approval or propose a monetary penalty and provide the gauger with the opportunity to respond to the notice of proposed action.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Specific grounds.</E> A gauger's approval may be suspended or revoked, or a monetary penalty may be assessed because:</P>
            <P>(A) The selection was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact by the gauger;</P>
            <P>(B) The gauger, a principal of the gauging facility, or a person the port director determines is exercising substantial ownership or control over the gauger operation is indicted for, convicted of, or has committed acts which would: under United States federal or state law, constitute a felony or misdemeanor involving misstatements, fraud, or a theft-related offense; or reflect adversely on the business integrity of the applicant. In the absence of an indictment, conviction, or other legal process, the port director must have probable cause to believe the proscribed acts occurred;</P>
            <P>(C) Staff gauger personnel refuse or otherwise fail to follow any proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or regulation;</P>
            <P>(D) The gauger fails to operate in accordance with the obligations of paragraph (b) of this section;</P>

            <P>(G) The gauger fails to maintain its bond;</P>
            <P>(H) The gauger fails to remit to Customs, at the billing address specified, within the 30 day billing period the fixed reapproval fee; or</P>
            <P>(I) The gauger fails to remit any monetary penalty assessed under this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Assessment of monetary penalties.</E> The assessment of a monetary penalty under this section, may be in lieu of, or in addition to, a suspension or revocation of approval under this section. The monetary penalty may not exceed $100,000 per violation and will be assessed and administered pursuant to published guidelines. Any monetary penalty under this section can be in addition to the recovery of:</P>
            <P>(A) Any loss of revenue, in cases where the gauger intentionally falsified the gauging report in collusion with the importer, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1499(b)(1)(B)(i); or</P>
            <P>(B) Liquidated damages assessed under the gauger's Customs bond.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of adverse action.</E> When a decision to suspend or revoke approval, and/or assess a monetary penalty is made, the Executive Director will immediately notify the gauger in writing, indicating whether the action is effective immediately or is proposed.</P>

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Proposed suspension, revocation, or assessment of monetary penalty</E>—(A) <E T="03">Preliminary notice.</E> Where the suspension or revocation of approval, and/or the assessment of a monetary penalty is proposed, the Executive Director will issue a preliminary notice of proposed action. The preliminary notice of proposed action will state the specific grounds for the proposed action, inform the gauger that it may continue to perform those functions requiring Customs-approval until the Executive Director's final notice is issued, and advise the gauger that it may file a response addressing the grounds for the action proposed with the Executive Director within 30 calendar days of the date the preliminary notice of proposed action was received by the gauger. The gauger may respond by accepting responsibility, explaining extenuating circumstances, and/or providing rebuttal evidence. The gauger also may ask for a meeting with the Executive Director or his designee to discuss the proposed action.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Final notice</E>—(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Based on nonresponse.</E> If the gauger does not respond to the preliminary notice of proposed action, the Executive Director will issue a final notice of adverse determination within 60 calendar days of the date the preliminary notice of proposed action was received by the gauger.

            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Based on response.</E> If the gauger files a timely response, the Executive Director will issue a final determination regarding the status of the gauger's approval within 30 calendar days of the date the gauger's response is received by the Executive Director.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemptions from applicability.</E> The provisions of this section are not applicable to detentions effected by CBP on behalf of other agencies of the U.S. Government in whom the determination of admissibility is vested and to <PRTPAGE P="200"/>detentions arising from possibly piratical copies (see part 133, subpart E, of this Chapter), goods bearing marks which are confusingly similar to recorded trademarks, or restricted gray market merchandise (see part 133, subpart C, of this chapter.)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Decision to detain or release.</E> Within the 5-day period (excluding weekends and holidays) following the date on which merchandise is presented for Customs examination, Customs shall decide whether to release or detain merchandise. Merchandise which is not released within such 5-day period shall be considered to be detained merchandise. For purposes of this section, merchandise shall be considered to be presented for Customs examination when it is in a condition to be viewed and examined by a Customs officer. Mere presentation to the examining officer of a cargo van, container or instrument of international traffic in which the merchandise to be examined is contained will not be considered to be presentation of merchandise for Customs examination for purposes of this section. Except when merchandise is examined at the public stores, the importer shall pay all costs relating to the preparation and transportation of merchandise for examination.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of detention.</E> If a decision to detain merchandise is made, or the merchandise is not released within the 5-day period, Customs shall issue a notice to the importer or other party having an interest in such merchandise no later than 5 days (excluding weekends and holidays) after such decision or failure to release (see paragraph (b) of this section). Issuance of a notice of detention is not to be construed as a final determination as to admissibility of the merchandise. The notice shall be prepared by the Customs officer detaining the merchandise and shall advise the importer or other interested party of the:</P>
            <P>(1) Initiation of the detention, including the date the merchandise was presented for examination;</P>
            <P>(2) Specific reason for the detention;</P>
            <P>(3) Anticipated length of the detention;</P>
            <P>(4) Nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted; and</P>
            <P>(5) Nature of any information which, if supplied to the Customs Service, may accelerate the disposition of the detention.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Providing testing results.</E> Upon written request by the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise, Customs shall provide copies of the results of any testing conducted on the merchandise together with a description of the testing procedures and methodologies used (unless such procedures or methodologies are proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent or were developed by Customs for enforcement purposes). The results and test description shall be in sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the testing and the results.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Final determinations.</E> A final determination with respect to admissibility of detained merchandise will be made within 30 days from the date the merchandise is presented for Customs examination. Such a determination may be the subject of a protest.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Effect of failure to make a determination.</E> The failure by Customs to make a final determination with respect to the admissibility of detained merchandise within 30 days after the merchandise has been presented for Customs examination, or such longer period if specifically authorized by law, shall be treated as a decision by Customs to exclude the merchandise for purposes of section 514(a)(4) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)(4)). Such a deemed exclusion may be the subject of a protest.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to decide protest.</E> If a protest which is filed as a result of a final determination or a deemed exclusion of detained merchandise is not allowed or denied in whole or in part before the 30th day after the day on which the protest was filed, it shall be treated as having been denied on such 30th day for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1581.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Decision before commencement of court action.</E> Customs may at any time after a deemed denial of a protest as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, but before commencement of a court action as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, grant a protest and <PRTPAGE P="201"/>permit release of detained merchandise, or deny a protest in accordance with § 174.30 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Commencement of court action; burden of proof and decisions of the court.</E> Once a court action respecting a detention is commenced, unless Customs establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an admissibility decision has not been reached for good cause, the court shall grant the appropriate relief which may include, but is not limited to, an order to cancel the detention and release the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Seizure and forfeiture; denial of entry or exportation.</E> If otherwise provided by law, detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited. In lieu of seizure and forfeiture, where authorized by law, Customs may deny entry and permit the merchandise to be exported, with the importer responsible for paying all expenses of exportation.</P>

            <P>(1) Opening ullages.</P>
            <P>(2) Closing ullages of carriers which have not completely discharged cargo, or if an importer or carrier requests Customs to witness closing ullages because of special problems.</P>
            <P>(3) Shore tank gauges performed by company or related-party employees.</P>
            <P>(4) Between 5 and 10 per cent of shore tank gauges conducted by commercial gaugers.</P>
            <P>(5) Shore tank gauges, including those conducted by a commercial gauger if no carrier ullages are taken.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Manifest discrepancies.</E> Manifest discrepancies (shortages and overages) shall be reported by or on behalf of the carrier in the manner specified in § 4.12 of this chapter.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Identical merchandise under decision favorable to Government.</E> The principles of any court decision favorable to the Government shall be applied to all merchandise identical with that passed on by the court which is covered by unliquidated entries, whether for consumption or warehouse.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Similar merchandise under decision favorable to Government.</E> The principles of any court decision favorable to the Government shall be applied to merchandise, though not identical with the merchandise the subject of the court's decision, if its classification is affected by such principles, provided that it has been entered or withdrawn for consumption after 30 days from the date of publication of the court's decision in the Customs Bulletin.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Higher rate.</E> If a court decision overruling a protest contains a definite statement that a higher rate than that assessed by the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, was properly chargeable, such higher rate shall be applied to all merchandise, whether identical or similar to that passed on by the court, which is affected by the principles of the court's decision and which is entered or withdrawn for consumption after 30 days from the date of the publication of the court's decision in the Customs Bulletin.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">American manufacturer's petition upheld.</E> If the court upholds a petition made by an American manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler under the provisions of section 516, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1516), the principles of the court's decision shall be applicable to all merchandise of that character which is entered or withdrawn for consumption after the date of publication of the court's decision in the Customs Bulletin. The liquidation of entries covering merchandise of that character made after publication of the court's decision shall be suspended in accordance with § 159.57 of this chapter pending any rehearing or review, then liquidated, or, if necessary, reliquidated in accordance with the final judicial decision.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Other decisions adverse to Government.</E> Unless the Commissioner of Customs otherwise directs, the principles <PRTPAGE P="214"/>of any court decision adverse to the Government (except for a decision upholding an American manufacturer's petition as covered in paragraph (d) of this section) shall be applied to unliquidated entries and protested entries which have not been denied in whole or in part and in which the same issue is involved as soon as the time within which an application for a rehearing or review may be filed has expired without such application having been made. See § 176.31 of this chapter for the treatment of entries which are the subject of a court decision.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The value for appraisement of merchandise exported to the United States on or after July 1, 1980, or, for articles classified under subheading 6401.10.00 Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), on or after July 1, 1981, will be determined in accordance with section 402, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a), as amended by section 201, Trade Agreements Act of 1979.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> Imported merchandise will be appraised on the basis, and in the order, of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The transaction value provided for in § 152.103;</P>
            <P>(2) The transaction value of identical merchandise provided for in § 152.104, if the transaction value cannot be determined, or can be determined but cannot be used because of the limitations provided for in § 152.103(j);</P>
            <P>(3) The transaction value of similar merchandise provided for in § 152.104, if the transaction value of identical merchandise cannot be determined;</P>
            <P>(4) The deductive value provided for in § 152.105, if the transaction value of similar merchandise cannot be determined;</P>
            <P>(5) The computed value provided for in § 152.106, if the deductive value cannot be determined; or</P>
            <P>(6) The value provided for in § 152.107, if the computed value cannot be determined.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Importer's option.</E> The importer may request the application of the computed value method before the deductive value method. The request must be made at the time the entry summary for the merchandise is filed with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically (see § 141.0a(b) of this chapter). If the importer makes the request, but the value of the imported merchandise cannot be determined using the computed value method, the merchandise will be appraised using the deductive value method if it is possible to do so. If the deductive value cannot be determined, the appraised value will be determined as provided for in § 152.107.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Explanation to importer.</E> Upon receipt of a written request from the importer within 90 days after liquidation, the Center director shall provide a reasonable and concise written explanation of how the value of the imported merchandise was determined. The explanation will apply only to the imported merchandise being appraised and will not serve as authority with respect to the valuation of importations of any other merchandise at the same or a different port of entry. This procedure is for informational purposes only, and will not affect or replace the protest or administrative ruling procedures contained in parts 174 and 177, respectively, of this chapter, or any other Customs procedures. Under this procedure, Customs will not be required to release any information not otherwise subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or any other statute (see part 103 of this chapter).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Price actually paid or payable</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> In determining transaction value, the price actually paid or payable will be considered without regard to its method of derivation. It may be the result of discounts, increases, or negotiations, or may be arrived at by the application of a formula, such as the price in effect on the date of export in the London Commodity Market. The word “payable” refers to a situation in which the price has been agreed upon, but actual payment has not been made at the time of importation. Payment may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments and may be made directly or indirectly.

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>In a transaction with foreign Company X, a U.S. firm pays Company X $10,000 for a shipment of meat products, packed ready for shipment to the United States. No selling commission, assist, royalty, or license fee is involved. Company X is not related to the U.S. purchaser and imposes no condition or limitation on the buyer.</P>
              <P>The customs value of the imported meat products is $10,000—the transaction value of the imported merchandise.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>A foreign shipper sold merchandise at $100 per unit to a U.S. importer. Subsequently, the foreign shipper increased its price to $110 per unit. The merchandise was exported after the effective date of the price increase. The invoice price of $100 was the price originally agreed upon and the price the U.S. importer actually paid for the merchandise.</P>
              <P>How should the merchandise be appraised?</P>
              <P>Actual transaction value of $100 per unit based on the price actually paid or payable.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
              <P>A foreign shipper sells to U.S. wholesalers at one price and to U.S. retailers at a higher price. The shipment undergoing appraisement is a shipment to a U.S. retailer. There are continuing shipments of identical and similar merchandise to U.S. wholesalers.</P>
              <P>How should the merchandise be appraised?</P>
              <P>Actual transaction value based on the price actually paid or payable by the retailer.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4.</HD>
              <P>Company X in the United States pay $2,000 to Y Toy Factory abroad for a shipment of toys. The $2,000 consists of $1,850 for the toys and $150 for ocean freight and insurance. Y Toy Factory would have charged Company X $2,200 for the toys; however, because Y owed Company X $350, Y charged only $1,850 for the toys. What is the transaction value?</P>
              <P>The transaction value of the imported merchandise is $2,200, that is, the sum of the $1,850 plus the $350 indirect payment. Because the transaction value excludes C.I.F. charges, the $150 ocean freight and insurance charge is excluded.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 5.</HD>
              <P>A seller offers merchandise at $100, less a 2% discount for cash. A buyer remits $98 cash, taking advantage of the cash discount.</P>
              <P>The transaction value is $98, the price actually paid or payable.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Indirect payment.</E> An indirect payment would include the settlement by the buyer, in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, or where the buyer receives a price reduction on a current importation as a means of settling a debt owed him by the seller. Activities such as advertising, undertaken by the buyer on his own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in § 152.103(b), will not be considered an indirect payment to the seller though they may benefit the seller. The costs of those activities will not be added to the price actually paid or payable in determining the customs value of the imported merchandise.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Assembled merchandise.</E> The price actually paid or payable may represent an amount for the assembly of imported merchandise in which the seller has no interest other than as the assembler. The price actually paid or payable in that case will be calculated by the addition of the value of the components and required adjustments to form the basis for the transaction value.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>The importer previously has supplied an unrelated foreign assembler with fabricated components ready for assembly having a value or cost at the assembler's plant of $1.00 per unit. The importer pays the assembler 50¢ per unit for the assembly. The transaction value for the assembled unit is $1.50.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>

              <P>Same facts as Example 1 above except the U.S. importer furnishes to the foreign assembler a tooling assist consisting of a tool acquired by the importer at $1,000. The transportation expenses to the foreign assembler's plant for the tooling assist equal $100. The transaction value for the assembled unit would be $1.50 per unit plus a <E T="03">pro rata</E> share of the tooling assist valued at $1,100.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Rebate.</E> Any rebate of, or other decrease in, the price actually paid or payable made or otherwise effected between the buyer and seller after the <PRTPAGE P="219"/>date of importation of the merchandise will be disregarded in determining the transaction value under § 152.103(b).</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Foreign inland freight and other inland charges incident to the international shipment of merchandise</E>—(i) <E T="03">Ex-factory sales.</E> If the price actually paid or payable by the buyer to the seller for the imported merchandise does not include a charge for foreign inland freight and other charges for services incident to the international shipment of merchandise (an ex-factory price), those charges will not be added to the price.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sales other than ex-factory.</E> As a general rule, in those situations where the price actually paid or payable for imported merchandise includes a charge for foreign inland freight, whether or not itemized separately on the invoices or other commercial documents, that charge will be part of the transaction value to the extent included in the price. However, charges for foreign inland freight and other services incident to the shipment of the merchandise to the United States may be considered incident to the international shipment of that merchandise within the meaning of § 152.102(f) if they are identified separately and they occur after the merchandise has been sold for export to the United States and placed with a carrier for through shipment to the United States.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Evidence of sale for export and placement for through shipment.</E> A sale for export and placement for through shipment to the United States under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section shall be established by means of a through bill of lading to be presented to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically. Only in those situations where it clearly would be impossible to ship merchandise on a through bill of lading (e.g., shipments via the seller's own conveyance) will other documentation satisfactory to the Center director showing a sale for export to the United States and placement for through shipment to the United States be accepted in lieu of a through bill of lading.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Erroneous and false information.</E> This regulation shall not be construed as prohibiting Customs from making appropriate additions to the dutiable value of merchandise in instances where verification reveals that foreign inland freight charges or other charges for services incident to the international shipment of merchandise have been overstated.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Additions to price actually paid or payable.</E> (1) The transaction value of imported merchandise is the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise when sold for exportation to the United States, plus amounts equal to:</P>
            <P>(i) The packing costs incurred by the buyer with respect to the imported merchandise;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any selling commission incurred by the buyer with respect to the imported merchandise;</P>
            <P>(iii) The value, apportioned as appropriate, of any assist;</P>
            <P>(iv) Any royalty or license fee related to the imported merchandise that the buyer is required to pay, directly or indirectly, as a condition of the sale of the imported merchandise for exportation to the United States; and</P>
            <P>(v) The proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise that accrue, directly or indirectly, to the seller.</P>
            <P>(2) The price actually paid or payable for imported merchandise will be increased by the amounts attributable to the items (and no others) described in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (v) of this section to the extent that each amount is not otherwise included within the price actually paid or payable, and is based on sufficient information. If sufficient information is not available, for any reason, with respect to any amount referred to in this section, the transaction value will be treated as one that cannot be determined.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Interpretative note.</E> A royalty is paid on the basis of the price in a sale in the United States of a gallon of a particular product imported by the pound and transformed into a solution after importation. If the royalty is based partially on the imported merchandise and partially on other factors which have nothing to do with the imported merchandise (such as if the imported merchandise is mixed with domestic ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or if the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the <PRTPAGE P="220"/>buyer and the seller), it would be inappropriate to attempt to make an addition for the royalty. However, if the amount of this royalty is based only on the imported merchandise and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable will be made.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Sufficiency of information.</E> Additions to the price actually paid or payable will be made only if there is sufficient information to establish the accuracy of the additions and the extent to which they are not included in the price.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Assist.</E> If the value of an assist is to be added to the price actually paid or payable, or to be used as a component of computed value, the Center director shall determine the value of the assist and apportion that value to the price of the imported merchandise in the following manner:</P>
            <P>(1) If the assist consist of materials, components, parts, or similar items incorporated in the imported merchandise, or items consumed in the production of the imported merchandise, acquired by the buyer from an unrelated seller, the value of the assist is the cost of its acquisition. If the assist were produced by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, its value would be the cost of its production. In either case, the value of the assist would include transportation costs to the place of production.</P>

            <P>(2) If the assist consists of tools, dies, molds, or similar items used in the production of the imported merchandise, acquired by the buyer from an unrelated seller,the value of the assist is the cost of its acquisition. If the assist were produced by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, its value would be cost of its production. If the assist has been used previously by the buyer, regardless of whether it had been acquired or produced by him, the original cost of acquisition or production would be adjusted downward to reflect its use before its value could be determined. If the assist were leased by the buyer from an unrelated seller, the value of the assist would be the cost of the lease. In either case, the value of the assist would include transportation costs to the place of production. Repairs or modifications to an assist may increase its value.

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>A U.S. importer supplied detailed designs to the foreign producer. These designs were necessary to manufacture the merchandise. The U.S. importer bought the designs from an engineering company in the U.S. for submission to his foreign supplier.</P>
              <P>Should the appraised value of the merchandise include the value of the assist?</P>
              <P>No, design work undertaken in the U.S. may not be added to the price actually paid or payable.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>A U.S. importer supplied molds free of charge to the foreign shipper. The molds were necessary to manufacture merchandise for the U.S. importer. The U.S. importer had some of the molds manufactured by a U.S. company and others manufactured in a third country.</P>
              <P>Should the appraised value of the merchandise include the value of the molds?</P>
              <P>Yes. It is an addition required to be made to transaction value.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Apportionment.</E> (1) The apportionment of the value of assists to imported merchandise will be made in a reasonable manner appropriate to the circumstances and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The method of apportionment actually accepted by Customs will depend upon the documentation submitted by the importer. If the entire anticipated production using the assist is for exportation to the United States, the total value may be apportioned over (i) the first shipment, if the importer wishes to pay duty on the entire value at once, (ii) the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment, or (iii) the entire anticipated production. In addition to these three methods, the importer may request some other method of apportionment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If the anticipated production is only partially for exportation to the United States, or if the assist is used in several countries, the method of apportionment will depend upon the documentation submitted by the importer.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Interpretative note.</E> An importer provides the producer with a mold to be used in the production of the imported merchandise and contracts to buy 10,000 units. By the time of arrival of the first shipment of 1,000 units, the producer has already produced 4,000 <PRTPAGE P="221"/>units. The importer may request Customs to apportion the value of the mold over 1,000, 4,000, 10,000 units, or any other figure which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Royalties or license fees.</E> Royalties or license fees for patents covering processes to manufacture the imported merchandise generally will be dutiable. Royalties or license fees paid to third parties for use, in the United States, of copyrights and trademarks related to the imported merchandise generally will be considered selling expenses of the buyer and not dutiable. The dutiable status of royalties or license fees paid by the buyer will be determined in each case and will depend on (1) whether the buyer was required to pay them as a condition of sale of the merchandise for exportation to the United States, and (2) to whom and under what circumstances they were paid. Payments made by the buyer to a third party for the right to distribute or resell the imported merchandise will not be added to the price actually paid or payable for the imported merchandise if the payments are not a condition of the sale of the merchandise for exportation to the United States.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>A foreign producer sold merchandise to an unrelated U.S. importer. The U.S. importer pays a royalty to an unrelated third party for the right to manufacture and sell a product made in part from the imported merchandise. The royalty is based on the selling price of the further-manufactured product in the U.S.</P>
              <P>Is the license fee part of the appraised value? No. The license fee is not a condition of the sale of the imported merchandise for export to the U.S.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Proceeds of subsequent resale.</E> Additions to the price actually paid or payable will be made for the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller. Dividends or other payments from the buyer to the seller which do not relate directly to the imported merchandise will not be added to the price actually paid or payable. Whether any addition would be made will depend on the facts of the particular case.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>A buyer contracts to import a new product. Not knowing whether the product ultimately will sell in the United States, the buyer agrees to pay the seller initially $1 per unit with an additional $1 per unit to be paid upon the sale of each unit in the United States. Assuming the resale price in the United States can be determined in a reasonable period of time, the transaction value of each unit would be $2. Otherwise, the transaction value could not be determined for want of sufficient information.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Right to reproduce.</E> Charges for the right to reproduce the imported merchandise in the United States will not be added to the price actually paid or payable. The right to reproduce denotes that an idea or an original work is incorporated in, or reflected by, the imported merchandise, and the right is reserved to reproduce that idea or work in other merchandise by using the imported merchandise. The concept of the right to reproduce relates only to the following classes of merchandise: originals or copies of artistic or scientific works; originals or copies of models and industrial drawings; model machines and prototypes; and plant and animal species.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>The importer purchases a painting. By purchasing the painting, the owner possesses the right to resell, lease, or otherwise place it on display. Absent an agreement to the contrary, he does not possess the right to reproduce copies of the painting. Fees paid for the right to reproduce the painting would not be dutiable.</P>

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Exclusions from transaction value.</E> The transaction value of imported merchandise does not include any of the following, if identified separately from the price actually paid or payable and from any cost or other item referred to in paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) Any reasonable cost or charge that is incurred for—</P>
            <P>(i) The construction, erection, assembly, or maintenance of, or the technical assistance provided with respect to, the merchandise after its importation into the United States; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The transportation of the merchandise after its importation.</P>

            <P>(2) The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on the imported merchandise by reason of its importation, and any Federal excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the <PRTPAGE P="222"/>merchandise for which vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable.

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>A foreign shipper sells a piece of equipment to a U.S. buyer. The total contract price for the equipment includes technical assistance in the U.S. The equipment cannot be purchased without the technical assistance, but the contract provides a breakdown of costs.</P>
              <P>Should the appraised value include the technical assistance? No, transaction value does not include any reasonable costs for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance of, or technical assistance, for the imported merchandise after its importation into the U.S., the cost of which can be accurately identified as being separate from the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise to which they relate.</P>

            <P>(j) <E T="03">Limitations on use of transaction value</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The transaction value of imported merchandise will be the appraised value only if:</P>
            <P>(i) There are no restrictions on the disposition or use of the imported merchandise by the buyer, other than restrictions which are imposed or required by law, limit the geographical area in which the merchandise may be resold, or do not affect substantially the value of the merchandise;</P>
            <P>(ii) The sale of, or the price actually paid or payable for, the imported merchandise is not subject to any condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined;</P>
            <P>(iii) No part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The buyer and seller are not related, or the buyer and seller are related but the transaction value is acceptable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Related person transactions.</E> (i) The transaction value between a related buyer and seller is acceptable if an examination of the circumstances of sale indicates that their relationship did not influence the price actually paid or payable, or if the transaction value of the imported merchandise closely approximates:</P>
            <P>(A) The transaction value of identical merchandise; or of similar merchandise, in sales to unrelated buyers in the United States; or</P>
            <P>(B) The deductive value or computed value of identical merchandise, or of similar merchandise; and</P>
            <P>(C) Each value referred to in paragraph (j)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this section that is used for comparison relates to merchandise that was exported to the United States at or about the same time as the imported merchandise.</P>
            <P>(ii) In applying the values used for comparison, differences with respect to the sales involved will be taken into account if based on sufficient information supplied by the buyer or otherwise available to Customs and if the differences relate to:</P>
            <P>(A) Commercial levels;</P>
            <P>(B) Quantity levels;</P>
            <P>(C) The costs, commissions, values, fees, and proceeds described in paragraph (b) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(D) The costs incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller and the buyer are related.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Restrictions and conditions on sale.</E> (1) A restriction placed on the buyer of imported merchandise that does not affect substantially its value will not prevent transaction value from being accepted as the appraised value.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Interpretative note.</E> A seller requires a buyer of automobiles not to sell or exhibit them before a fixed date that represents the beginning of a model year.</P>
            <P>(2) The transaction value will not be accepted as the appraised value if the sale of, or the price actually paid or payable for, the merchandise is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Interpretative note 1.</E> The seller establishes the price of the imported merchandise on condition that the buyer also will buy other merchandise in specified quantities.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Interpretative note 2.</E> The price of the imported merchandise is dependent upon the price or prices at which the buyer of the merchandise sells other merchandise to the seller of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Interpretative note 3.</E> The price of the imported merchandise is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the merchandise, such as where the merchandise is to be <PRTPAGE P="223"/>further processed by the buyer, and has been provided by the seller on condition that he will receive a specified quantity of the finished merchandise.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Related buyer and seller</E>—(1) <E T="03">Validation of transaction.</E> The Center director shall not disregard a transaction value solely because the buyer and seller are related. There will be related person transactions in which validation of the transaction value, using the procedures contained in § 152.103(j)(2), may not be necessary.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Interpretative note 1.</E> Customs may have previously examined the relationship or may already have sufficient detailed information concerning the buyer and seller to be satisfied that the relationship did not influence the price actually paid or payable. In such case, if Customs has no doubts about the acceptability of the price, the price will be accepted without requesting further information from the importer. If Customs does have doubts about the acceptability of the price and is unable to accept the transaction value without further inquiry, the importer will be given an opportunity to supply such further detailed information as may be necessary to enable Customs to examine the circumstances of the sale. In this context, Customs will examine relevant aspects of the transaction, including the way in which the buyer and seller organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price in question was arrived at in order to determine whether the relationship influenced the price.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Interpretative note 2.</E> If it is shown that the buyer and seller, although related, buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related, this will demonstrate that the price has not been influenced by the relationship, and the transaction value will be accepted. If the price has been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question, or with the way the seller settles prices for sales to buyers who are not related to him, this will demonstrate that the price has not been influenced by the relationship.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Interpretative note 3.</E> If it is shown that the price is adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit which is equivalent to the firm's overall profit realized over a representative period of time (e.g., on an annual basis), in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind, this would demonstrate that the price has not been influenced.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>A foreign seller sells merchandise to a related U.S. importer. The foreign seller does not sell identical merchandise or similar merchandise to any unrelated parties. The transaction between the foreign seller and the U.S. importer is determined by Customs to be unaffected by the relationship.</P>
              <P>How should the merchandise be appraised?</P>
              <P>Transaction value based on the price actually paid or payable. A transaction value between a related buyer and seller is acceptable if the relationship did not affect the price actually paid or payable. This is so even if similar merchandise is being sold at a higher price, which includes a higher percentage for profit and general expenses.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Test values.</E> (i) The importer or the buyer may demonstrate that the transaction value in a related person transaction is acceptable by showing that the value “closely approximates” any one of the test values provided in § 152.103(j)(2)(i). The factors that will be examined to determine if the transaction value closely approximates a test value include:</P>
            <P>(A) The nature of the imported merchandise and the industry,</P>
            <P>(B) The season in which the merchandise is imported,</P>
            <P>(C) Whether the difference in value is commercially significant, and</P>
            <P>(D) Whether the difference in value is attributable to internal transport costs in the country of exportation.</P>

            <P>(ii) Because these factors may vary, Customs will not be able to apply a uniform standard, such as a fixed percentage, in each case. A small difference in value in a case involving one type of imported merchandise may be unacceptable, although a large difference in a case involving another type may be acceptable, in determining if the transaction value closely approximates any of the test values. Customs will be consistent in determining if one value “closely approximates” another value. The same approach will be taken if Customs considers a transaction value that is higher than any of the enumerated test values as will be taken if the transaction value is lower than any of the test values.

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>In applying any of the test values, if the transaction value in the sale under consideration is rejected because 95 does not closely approximate 100, then a transaction value for the sale of the same merchandise at 105 occurring at or about the same time likewise would have to be rejected. Similarly, if 103 were considered to closely approximate 100, a transaction value of 97 likewise would closely approximate 100.</P>

            <P>(iii) If one of the test values provided in § 152.103(j)(2)(i) has been found to be appropriate, the Center director shall not seek to determine if the relationship between the buyer and seller influenced the price. If the Center director already has sufficient information to be satisfied, without further detailed inquiries, that one of the test values is appropriate, he shall not require the importer to demonstrate that the test value is appropriate.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Rejection of transaction value.</E> When CBP has grounds for rejecting the transaction value declared by an importer and that rejection increases the duty liability, the Center director shall inform the importer of the grounds for the rejection. The importer will be afforded 20 days to respond in writing to the Center director if in disagreement. This procedure will not affect or replace the administrative ruling procedures contained in part 177 of this chapter, or any other CBP procedures.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Transaction value of identical merchandise and similar merchandise.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The transaction value of identical merchandise, or of similar merchandise, is the transaction value (acceptable as the appraised value under § 152.103 but adjusted under paragraph (e) of this section) of imported merchandise that is—</P>
            <P>(1) With respect to the merchandise being appraised, either identical merchandise, or similar merchandise; and</P>
            <P>(2) Exported to the United States at or about the time that the merchandise being appraised is exported to the United States.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Identical merchandise.</E> Minor differences in appearance will not preclude otherwise conforming merchandise from being considered “identical”. See § 152.102(d).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Similar merchandise.</E> The quality of the merchandise, its reputation, and the existence of a trademark will be factors considered to determine whether merchandise is “similar”. See § 152.102(i).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Commercial level and quantity.</E> Transaction values determined under this section will be based on sales of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity as the sales of the merchandise being appraised. If no such sale is found, sales of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, at either a different commercial level or in different quantities, or both, will be used, but adjusted to take account of that difference. Any adjustment made under this section will be based on “sufficient information”. See § 152.102(j). If in applying this section to any merchandise, two or more transaction values for identical merchandise, or for similar merchandise, are determined, the merchandise will be appraised on the basis of the lower or lowest of those values.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Adjustments.</E> (1) Adjustments for identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, because of different commercial levels or quantities, or both, whether leading to an increase or decrease in the value, will be made only on the basis of sufficient information; e.g., valid price lists containing prices referring to different levels or quantities.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Interpretative note.</E> If the imported merchandise being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical imported merchandise for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's price list and using that price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being <PRTPAGE P="225"/>
              <E T="03">bona fide</E> through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a customs value under the provisions for transaction value of identical or similar merchandise is not appropriate.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Deductive value.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Merchandise concerned.</E> For the purposes of deductive value, “merchandise concerned” means the merchandise being appraised, identical merchandise, or similar merchandise.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Merchandise of the same class or kind.</E> For the purposes of deductive value, “merchandise of the same class or kind” includes merchandise imported from the same country as well as other countries as the merchandise being appraised.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prices.</E> The deductive value of the merchandise being appraised is whichever of the following prices (as adjusted under paragraph (d) of this section) is appropriate depending upon when and in what condition the merchandise concerned is sold in the United States:</P>
            <P>(1) If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as imported at or about the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity at or about such date.</P>
            <P>(2) If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as imported but not sold at or about the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity after the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised but before the close of the 90th day after the date of such importation.</P>
            <P>(3) If the merchandise concerned was not sold in the condition as imported and not sold before the close of the 90th day after the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise being appraised, after further processing, is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity before the 180th day after the date of such importation. This provision will apply to appraisement of merchandise only if the importer so elects at the time of filing the entry summary.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Deductions from price.</E> The price determined under paragraph (c) of this section will be reduced by an amount equal to:</P>
            <P>(1) Any commission usually paid or agreed to be paid, or the addition usually made for profit and general expenses, in connection with sales in the United States of imported merchandise that is of the same class or kind, regardless of the country of exportation, as the merchandise concerned;</P>
            <P>(2) The actual costs and associated costs of transportation and insurance incurred with respect to international shipments of the merchandise concerned from the country of exportation to the United States;</P>
            <P>(3) The usual costs and associated costs of transportation and insurance incurred with respect to shipments of the merchandise concerned from the place of importation to the place of delivery in the United States, if those costs are not included as a general expense under paragraph (d)(1) of this section;</P>
            <P>(4) The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on the merchandise concerned by reason of its importation, and any Federal excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the merchandise for which vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable; and</P>
            <P>(5) But only in the case of price determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the value added by the processing of the merchandise after importation to the extent that the value is based on sufficient information relating to the cost of that processing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Profit and general expenses; special rules.</E> (1) The deduction made for profit and general expenses (taken as a whole) will be based upon the importer's profit and general expenses, unless the profit and general expenses are inconsistent with those reflected in sales in the United States of imported merchandise of the same class or kind from all countries, in which case the deduction will be based on the usual profit and general expenses reflected in those <PRTPAGE P="226"/>sales, as determined from sufficient information. Any State or local tax imposed on the importer with respect to the sale of imported merchandise will be treated as a general expense.</P>
            <P>(2) In determining deductions for commissions and usual profit and general expenses, sales in the United States of the narrowest group or range of imported merchandise of the same class or kind, including the merchandise being appraised, for which sufficient information can be provided, will be examined.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Packing costs.</E> The price determined under paragraph (c) of this section will be increased, but only to the extent that the costs are not otherwise included, by an amount equal to the packing costs incurred by the importer or the buyer with respect to the merchandise concerned.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Assists.</E> For purposes of determining deductive value, any sale to a person who supplies any assist for use in connection with the production or sale for export of the merchandise concerned will be disregarded.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Unit price in greatest aggregate quantity.</E> The unit price will be established after a sufficient number of units have been sold to an unrelated person. The unit price to be used when the units have been sold in different quantities will be that at which the total volume sold is greater than the total volume sold at any other unit price.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Interpretative note 1.</E> Merchandise is sold to an unrelated person from a price list which grants favorable unit prices for purchases made in larger quantities:</P>

              <P>A foreign shipper sells merchandise to a related U.S. importer. The foreign shipper does not sell to any unrelated person. The transaction between the foreign shipper and the U.S. importer is determined to have been affected by the relationship.

            <SUBJECT>Computed value.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Elements.</E> The computed value of imported merchandise is the sum of:</P>
            <P>(1) The cost or value of the materials and the fabrication and other processing of any kind employed in the production of the imported merchandise;</P>
            <P>(2) An amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the imported merchandise that are made by the producers in the country of exportation for export to the United States;</P>
            <P>(3) Any assist, if its value is not included under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(4) The packing costs.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Special rules.</E> (1) The cost or value of materials under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not include the amount of any internal tax imposed by the country of exportation that is directly applicable to the materials or their disposition if the tax is remitted or refunded upon the exportation of the merchandise in the production of which the materials were used.</P>
            <P>(2) The amount for profit and general expenses under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be based upon the producer's profit and general expenses, unless the producer's profit and general expenses are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the imported merchandise that are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the United States. In that case, the amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be based on the usual profit and general expenses of such producers in those sales, as determined from “sufficient information”. See § 152.102(j).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Profit and general expenses.</E> The amount for profit and general expenses will be taken as a whole. If the producer's profit figure is low and general expenses high, those figures taken together nevertheless may be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of imported merchandise of the same class or kind.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Interpretative note 1.</E> A product is introduced into the United States, and the producer accepts either no profit or a low profit to offset the high general expenses required to introduce the product into this market. If the producer can demonstrate that there is a low profit on sales of the imported merchandise because of peculiar commercial circumstances, the actual profit figures will be accepted provided the producer has valid commercial reasons to justify them and his pricing policy reflects the usual pricing policies in the industry.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Interpretative note 2.</E> Producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforseeable drop in demand, or they sell merchandise to complement a range of merchandise being produced in the United States and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. If the producer's own figures for profit and general expenses are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the merchandise being valued which are made in the country of exportation for export to the United States, the amount for profit and general expenses will be based upon reliable and quantifiable information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Assists and packing costs.</E> Computed value also will include an <PRTPAGE P="228"/>amount equal to the apportioned value of any assists used in the production of the imported merchandise and the packing costs for the imported merchandise. The value of any engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches undertaken in the United States will be included in computed value only to the extent that their value has been charged to the producer. Depending on the producer's method of accounting, the value of assists may be included (duplicated) in the producer's cost of materials, fabrication, and other processing, or in the general expenses. If duplication occurs, a separate amount for the value of the assists will not be added to the other elements as it is not intended that any component of computed value be included twice.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Merchandise of same class or kind.</E> Sales for export to the United States of the narrowest group or range of imported merchandise, including the merchandise being appraised, will be examined to determine usual profit and general expenses. For the purpose of computed value, merchandise of the same class or kind must be from the same country as the merchandise being appraised.

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example.</HD>
              <P>A foreign shipper sells merchandise to a related U.S. importer. The foreign shipper does not sell to any unrelated persons. The transaction between the foreign shipper and the U.S. importer is determined to have been affected by the relationship. There is no identical or similar merchandise from the same country of production. The U.S. importer further processes the product and sells the finished product to an unrelated buyer in the U.S. within 180 days of the date of importation. No assists from the unrelated U.S. buyer are involved, and the type of processing involved can be accurately costed. The U.S. importer has requested that the shipment be appraised under computed value. The profit and general expenses figure for the same class or kind of merchandise in the country of exportation for export to the U.S. is known.</P>
              <P>How should the merchandise be appraised?</P>
              <P>The merchandise should be appraised under computed value, using the company's profit and general expenses if not inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind.</P>

Only information available in the United States will be used.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Identical merchandise or similar merchandise.</E> The requirement that identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, should be exported at or about the same time of exportation as the merchandise being appraised may be interpreted flexibly. Identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, produced in any country other than the country of exportation or production of the merchandise being appraised may be the basis for customs valuation.

            <SUBJECT>Rounding of fractions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Value.</E> In the computation of duty on entries, ad valorem rates shall be applied to the values in even dollars, fractional parts of a dollar less than 50 cents being disregarded and 50 cents or more being considered as $1, with all merchandise in the same invoice subject to the same rate of duty to be treated as a unit. However, the total dutiable value of the invoice shall not be increased or decreased by more than the rounding of the total dutiable value to an even dollar. When necessary, fractional parts of a dollar, <PRTPAGE P="238"/>whether more or less than 50 cents, shall be dropped or taken up as whole dollars in order to avoid such an increase or decrease. If in such cases it is necessary to drop fractional parts of a dollar amounting to 50 cents or more, the lower fractions shall be dropped, and if it is necessary to take up as whole dollars fractional parts less than 50 cents, the larger fractions shall be taken. In the case of two equal fractions, the one subject to the lower rate of duty shall be dropped or taken up, as the case may be. In determining a rate of duty dependent upon value, fractional parts of a dollar shall be considered.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Quantities subject to specific duty.</E> Except in the case of alcoholic beverages treated under § 159.4, if a rate of duty is specific and $1 or less per unit, fractional quantities, if less than one-half, shall be disregarded, and if one-half or more shall be treated as a whole unit. Subject to the same exception, if a specific rate is more than $1 per unit, duty shall be assessed upon the exact quantity with any fractional part expressed in the form of a decimal extended to two places.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Quantities subject to duties.</E> Customs duties and internal revenue taxes on alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2207 and 2208, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), (19 U.S.C. 1202), and subject to internal revenue taxes shall be collected only on the number of proof gallons and fractional parts thereof, entered or withdrawn for consumption. No internal revenue tax shall be collected on distilled spirits in bulk which have been transferred to Internal Revenue bonded premises in accordance with § 141.102(b) of this chapter. Customs duties and internal revenue taxes on alcoholic beverages other than subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.90, HTSUS, and distilled spirits provided for in headings 2207 and 2208, shall be collected only on the number of wine gallons and fractional parts thereof, entered or withdrawn for consumption.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of duties.</E> In the computation of Customs duties on alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2207 and 2208 (19 U.S.C. 1202), which are also subject to internal revenue taxes, the methods prescribed for the computation of internal revenue taxes on such beverages shall be followed. The following methods apply to the specific beverages shown:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Distilled spirits.</E> The quantity of distilled spirits imported in barrels, kegs, or similar containers shall be ascertained in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Where distilled spirits are imported in bottles, jugs, or similar containers, Customs duties and taxes shall be collected on the exact quantity contained in each case or other outer container, fractional parts of a gallon being carried out to three decimal places utilizing the proof gallon method of computation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Wine.</E> Customs duties and taxes on wines shall be on the basis of a wine gallon of liquid measure equivalent to 231 cubic inches and shall be paid proportionally on all fractional parts of a wine gallon. Fractions of less than one-tenth gallon shall be converted to the nearest one-tenth gallon, and five-hundredths gallon shall be converted to the next full one-tenth gallon.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Beer and similar fermented beverages.</E> Customs duties and taxes on beer, ale, porter, stout, and other similar fermented beverages, including sake, of any name or description containing one-half of 1 percent or more of alcohol by volume, brewed or produced from malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute therefor, shall be collected in accordance with section 5051(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5051(a)).</P>

            <P>The internal revenue taxes imposed on cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes under section 5701 or 7652, Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5701 or 7652), are determined in accordance with section 5703 of that Code (26 U.S.C. 5703) at the time of removal; that is, on the quantity removed from Customs custody under the entry or withdrawal for consumption. <PRTPAGE P="239"/>The Customs duties, unlike those on alcoholic beverages, do not necessarily apply only to such quantities.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Difference under $20 in original liquidation.</E> When there is a net difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the liquidation of any entry (other than an informal, mail, or baggage entry) and the total amount of estimated duties, fees, and taxes deposited, including any supplemental deposit, the difference will be disregarded and the entry endorsed “as entered.” In the case of an informal, mail, or baggage entry, the amount of duties, fees, and taxes computed by a CBP officer when the entry is prepared by, or filed with, him will be considered the liquidated assessment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Difference under $20 in reliquidation.</E> When there is a net difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest found due in the reliquidation of any entry and the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the prior liquidation of the entry, the difference will be disregarded except in the following cases:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Reliquidation at importer's request.</E> When reliquidation of any entry is made at the importer's request, such as reliquidation following the allowance of a protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), or, for entries made before December 18, 2004, a request for correction under section 520(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1520(c)), any refund determined to be due will be refunded even if less than $20.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Court decision.</E> Any refund or increase determined to be due as the result of the reliquidation of an entry in accordance with a court decision and judgment order will be refunded or collected as the case may be.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Difference of $20 or more collected or refunded.</E> If there is a difference of $20 or more between the duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the liquidation of an entry and the total estimated duties, fees, and taxes deposited, or between the total duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the reliquidation of an entry and those assessed in the prior liquidation, the entry will be endorsed to show the difference and bills or refund checks will be issued.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Customs duties and fees and internal revenue taxes and interest netted for $20 limit.</E> The assessments of customs duties and fees and internal revenue taxes and interest will be separately stated on the entry at the time of liquidation, but the amounts of any differences will be netted when applying the $20 minimum for issuance of a bill or refund check.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Merchandise excluded from liquidation of original warehouse entry.</E> When any of the following types of merchandise are withdrawn from warehouse for transportation to another port, they will be excluded from the liquidation of the original warehouse entry, and the liability for duties will be determined by a liquidation of the rewarehouse entry made at the port where the merchandise is withdrawn for consumption or for exportation:</P>
            <P>(1) Alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2203 through 2208, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), and subject to internal revenue taxes;</P>
            <P>(2) Cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes subject to internal revenue taxes;</P>

            <P>(4) Wool or hair subject to duty at a rate per clean kilogram under Chapter 51, HTSUS.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reliquidation required by change in rate.</E> When a rate of customs duty or tax is changed by an act of Congress or a proclamation of the President, any necessary reliquidation of customs duty or tax on merchandise covered by a rewarehouse entry which may be required by reason of the change in rate <PRTPAGE P="240"/>will be made by the Center director on the effective date of the change.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Shortage, irregular delivery, nondelivery, and other cases.</E> In cases involving shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelivery under the original warehouse withdrawal for transportation, or in other cases when the Center director is of the opinion that circumstances make it inadvisable to follow the liquidation of the original warehouse entry, he will make an appropriate adjustment in the amount of duties to be assessed under the rewarehouse entry.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Extension of time for liquidation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Reasons</E>—(1) <E T="03">Extension.</E> The Center director may extend the 1-year statutory period for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed 1 year if:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Information needed by CBP.</E> Information needed by CBP for the proper appraisement or classification of the merchandise is not available, or</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Importer's request.</E> The importer requests an extension in writing before the statutory period expires and shows good cause why the extension should be granted. “Good cause” is demonstrated when the importer satisfies the Center <PRTPAGE P="242"/>director that more time is needed to present to CBP information which will affect the pending action, or there is a similar question under review by CBP.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Suspension.</E> The 1-year liquidation period may be suspended as required by statute or court order.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of extension.</E> If the Center director extends the time for liquidation, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the official notice of extension and reasons therefor will be posted on <E T="03">www.cbp.gov.</E> The notice of extension will be maintained on <E T="03">www.cbp.gov</E> for a minimum of 15 months from the date of posting. The Center director will also endeavor to transmit a courtesy notice of extension to the entry filer or its agent and the surety on an entry through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of suspension.</E> If the liquidation of an entry is suspended as required by statute or court order, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the official notice of suspension will be posted on <E T="03">www.cbp.gov.</E> The notice of suspension will be maintained on <E T="03">www.cbp.gov</E> for a minimum of 15 months from the date of posting. The Center director will also endeavor to transmit a courtesy notice of suspension to the entry filer or its agent and the surety on an entry through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional extensions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Information needed by CBP.</E> If an extension has been granted because CBP needs more information and the Center director thereafter determines that more time is needed, he may extend the time for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed 1 year provided he issues the notice required by paragraph (b) of this section before termination of the prior extension period.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">At importer's request.</E> If the statutory period has been extended for one year at the importer's request, and the importer thereafter determines that additional time is necessary, it may request another extension in writing before the original extension expires, giving reasons for its request. If the Center director finds that good cause (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) exists, the official notice of extension extending the time for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed one year will be posted on <E T="03">www.cbp.gov,</E> and CBP will provide courtesy notice of the extension to the entry filer or its agent and the surety on an entry through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Limitation on extensions.</E> The total time for which extensions may be granted by the Center director may not exceed 3 years.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Time limitation.</E> An entry not liquidated within four years from either the date of entry, or the date of final withdrawal of all the merchandise covered by a warehouse entry, will be deemed liquidated by operation of law at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and amount of duty asserted by the importer of record, unless liquidation continues to be suspended by statute or court order. CBP will endeavor to provide a courtesy notice of liquidation, in accordance with § 159.9(d), in addition to the notice specified in § 159.9(c)(2)(i).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Rates to be published.</E> When the Federal Reserve Bank of New York certifies two or more rates of exchange for the currency of any country, those <PRTPAGE P="245"/>rates will be published in the Customs Bulletin.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Laws of country of exportation followed.</E> When multiple rates have been certified for a foreign currency, the rate to be used for Customs purposes shall be the type of certified rate which the Center director is satisfied, from information in his own files, information obtained and presented to him by the importer, or information obtained from other sources, is uniformly applicable under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation to the particular class of merchandise on the date of exportation. In cases where two or more types of certified rates are uniformly applicable on a percentage bases, each type of certified rate shall be used for the percentage of value to which it is applicable. The percentages used shall be those which reflect realistically the percentage for which each type of rate is uniformly applicable under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation on the date of exportation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure when multiple certified rates not uniformly applicable.</E> If the Center director has credible information that a type of rate or combination of types of rates which would otherwise be applicable under paragraph (b) of this section were not required or permitted, as the case may be, under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation to be used uniformly during any period in connection with the payment for all merchandise of the class involved, he shall immediately submit a detailed report to the Commissioner of Customs, and shall suspend appraisement and liquidation as to all merchandise of the class involved exported to the United States during the period involved, until instructions are received from the Commissioner of Customs.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Rate for merchandise different from rate for costs.</E> If the Center director has credible information that a type of rate or combination of types of rates not applicable to payment for the merchandise was required or permitted in payment of costs, charges, or expenses, the currency conversions for the exchange covering payment for the merchandise and for the exchange covering such costs, charges, or expenses shall be calculated separately. In deducting nondutiable costs, charges, or expenses, the foreign exchange shall be at the rate or rates actually used in payment of such costs, charges, or expenses, whether or not certified in accordance with § 159.34 or § 159.35. If the costs, charges or expenses are dutiable, they shall be calculated according to the rules set forth in this subpart. In the event that any type of rate uniformly applicable to payment of such dutiable costs, charges, or expenses for merchandise of the class involved was a type of rate not certified in accordance with § 159.34 or § 159.35, the Center director shall immediately submit a detailed report to the Commissioner of Customs, and shall suspend appraisement and liquidation as to all merchandise of the class involved exported to the United States during the period involved, until instructions are received from the Commissioner.</P>

            <P>Whenever the Federal Reserve Bank of New York advises that its certification of rates for a currency is being suspended pending determination of the question whether it will certify multiple rates for that currency, the following procedures shall apply:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification of suspension.</E> Customs field officers will be informed when certification of a currency is being suspended. Currency information received from the Federal Reserve Bank, or otherwise available, which might be helpful in calculating estimated duties during the period of suspension will be furnished to the Customs field officers.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Suspension of liquidation.</E> In any case where for the purposes of the assessment and collection of duties it is necessary to determine the proper rate or rates for a currency during the period when it has been suspended from certification, appraisement and liquidation shall be suspended until resumption of certification.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Resumption of certification.</E> When certification is resumed by the Federal Reserve Bank, the procedures in § 159.36 shall apply.</P>

            <P>For purposes of calculating estimated duties, the Center director shall use the rate or rates appearing to be applicable under the instructions in this subpart to the merchandise involved. When it is not yet known what certified rate or rates are applicable or no rate has been certified, the Center director shall take into account all the information in his possession and shall use the highest rate or combination of rates (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the rate or combination of rates showing the highest amount of United States money), certified or uncertified as the case may be, which could be applicable.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Continued dumping and subsidy offset.</E> Under section 754 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by Public Law 106-387, 114 Stat. 1549 (19 U.S.C. 1675c), known as the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000, assessed duties received on or after October 1, 2000 under a countervailing duty order, an antidumping duty order, or a finding under the Antidumping Act of 1921, will be distributed, as provided under this subpart, to affected domestic producers for certain qualifying expenditures that these affected domestic producers incur after the issuance of such an antidumping duty order or finding, or countervailing duty order. This distribution is called the continued dumping and subsidy offset.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Affected domestic producer</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an “affected domestic producer” under paragraph (a) of this section means any manufacturer, producer, farmer, rancher or worker representative (including any association of such persons) that remains in operation continuing to produce the product covered by the antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order, and that was a petitioner or an interested party that supported a petition concerning an antidumping duty order, a finding under the Antidumping Act of 1921, or a countervailing duty order that was entered. It is the responsibility of the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) to ascertain and timely forward to Customs a list of the domestic producers potentially considered “affected domestic producers” eligible to receive a distribution in connection with each order or finding. In addition to the potential “affected domestic producers” set forth on the USITC list, the following parties also are potential “affected domestic producers”:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Successor company.</E> In the case of a company that has succeeded to the operations of a predecessor company that appeared on the USITC list, the successor company may file a certification to claim an offset as an affected domestic producer on behalf of the predecessor company. In its certification, the company must name the predecessor company to which it has succeeded and it must describe in detail the duly authorized succession by which it is entitled to file the certification.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">A member company of an association.</E> A member company of an association appearing on the USITC list for an order or finding may file a certification to claim an offset as an affected domestic producer, even though the member company does not itself appear on the USITC list, provided that the company also meets the other requirements of the statute. In its certification, the company must name the association of which it is a member and the company must specifically establish that it was a member of the association at the time the association filed the petition with the USITC.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> A party who is named on the USITC list is not an “affected domestic producer” under the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Product no longer produced.</E> A company, business or person that has ceased production of the product covered by the antidumping duty order or finding, or countervailing duty order, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> did not manufacture that product at all during the fiscal year that is the subject of the disbursement, is not an affected domestic producer under this section.<PRTPAGE P="249"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Acquisition by related company</E>—(A) <E T="03">Related company defined.</E> A company, business or person is not an affected domestic producer if that company, business, or person has been acquired by another company or business that is related to a company that opposed the antidumping or countervailing duty investigation that led to the order or finding. For purposes of this paragraph, a company, business or person is related to another company, business or person if:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The company, business or person directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by the other company, business or person;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A third party directly or indirectly controls both companies, businesses or persons; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Both companies, businesses or persons directly or indirectly control a third party and there is reason to believe that the relationship causes the first company, business or person to act differently than a nonrelated party.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Control of one party by another.</E> For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (b)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section, one party would be considered to directly or indirectly control another party if the party was legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other party.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Qualifying expenditures.</E> Qualifying expenditures which may be offset by a distribution of assessed antidumping and countervailing duties must fall within the categories described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(10) of this section. These expenditures must be incurred after the issuance, and prior to the termination, of the antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order under which the distribution is sought. Further, these expenditures must be related to the production of the same product that is the subject of the related order or finding, with the exception of expenses incurred by associations which must relate to a specific case.</P>

            <P>(ii) The total amount of those expenditures which have been the subject of any prior distribution under section 754, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675c); and</P>
            <P>(iii) The net amount for new and remaining qualifying expenditures being claimed in the current certification (the total amount currently and previously certified as noted in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section minus the total amount the subject of any prior distribution as noted in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Statement of eligibility to receive distribution.</E> The certification must contain a statement that the domestic producer desires to receive a distribution and is eligible to receive the distribution as an affected domestic producer (see § 159.61(b)(1) and (b)(2)).</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Amount certified for payment.</E> The affected domestic producer must affirm that the net amount certified for distribution does not encompass any qualifying expenditures for which distribution has previously been made (see paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Same qualifying expenditures included on more than one certification.</E> Where the domestic producer is listed as an affected domestic producer on more than one order or finding covering the same product and files a separate certification for each order or finding using the same qualifying expenditures as the basis for distribution in each case, each certification must list all the other orders or findings where the producer is claiming the same qualifying expenditures.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Continued production of product covered by order or finding; acquisition by related company.</E> The statement must include information as to whether the domestic producer remains in operation and continues to produce the product covered by the particular order or finding under which the distribution is sought (see § 159.61(b)(2)(i)). In addition, the domestic producer must state whether it has been acquired by a company or business that is related to a company, within the meaning of § 159.61(b)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>), that opposed the antidumping or countervailing duty investigation that resulted in the order or finding under which the distribution is sought.<PRTPAGE P="251"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Review and correction of certification.</E> A certification that is submitted in response to a notice of distribution and received within 60 days after the date of publication of the notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> may be reviewed before acceptance to ensure that all informational requirements are complied with and that any amounts set forth in the certification for current and prior qualifying expenditures, including the amount claimed for distribution, appear to be correct (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section). A certification that is found to be materially incorrect or incomplete will be returned to the domestic producer within 15 days after the close of the 60-day filing period. Within 10 days of the date that Customs returns a certification as being materially incorrect or incomplete, Customs must receive a corrected certification from the affected domestic producer. Customs will make every effort to assist companies to perfect their certifications and will not return claims for minor errors or omissions. However, it remains the sole responsibility of the domestic producer to ensure that the certification is correct, complete and satisfactory so as to demonstrate the entitlement of the domestic producer to the distribution requested. Failure to ensure that the certification is correct, complete and satisfactory as provided in this paragraph will result in the domestic producer not receiving a distribution.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Verification of certification; supporting records.</E> Certifications are subject to verification. Parties, therefore, are required to maintain the accounting records used in developing their claims, for a period of five years after the filing of the certification. The records supporting certifications must be those that are normally kept in the ordinary course of business (see § 163.1(a)(1) and (a)(2)(vi) of this chapter). Parties must be able to demonstrate that their records specifically support each qualifying expenditure enumerated in a certification. In addition, the claimant must be able to support how qualifying expenditures are determined to be related to the production of the product covered by the order or finding.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Disclosure of information in certifications; acceptance by producer.</E> The name of the affected domestic producer, the total dollar amount claimed by that party on the certification, as well as the total dollar amount that Customs actually disburses to that company as an offset, will be available for disclosure to the public (see § 159.64(g)(1)). The submission of the certification will be construed as an understanding and acceptance on the part of the domestic producer that this information will be disclosed to the public. Alternatively, a statement in a certification that this information is proprietary and exempt from disclosure will result in Customs rejection of the certification.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 159.64</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Distribution of offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">The creation of Special Accounts and Clearing Accounts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Special Accounts.</E> As directed in the legislation (19 U.S.C. 1675c(e)), Customs will establish Special Accounts for each antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order, into which funds will be transferred as set out in paragraph (b) of this section. All distributions to affected domestic producers will be made from the Special Accounts.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Clearing Accounts.</E> In order to properly manage and account for dumping and subsidy offsets, as well as any requisite refunds to importers, Customs will also establish Clearing Accounts. All estimated antidumping and countervailing duties received pursuant to an antidumping or countervailing order or finding in effect on January 1, 1999, or thereafter, will be deposited into a Clearing Account.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Distribution of assessed duties received from the Special Accounts; refunds resulting from reliquidation or court action; and overpayments to affected domestic producers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Distribution of assessed duties received from the Special Accounts.</E> (i) No later than 60 days after the end of a fiscal year, Customs will distribute the assessed duties transferred from the Clearing Accounts and received into the Special Accounts. The amount <PRTPAGE P="252"/>distributed shall be referred to as the dumping and subsidy offset;</P>
            <P>(ii) Transfers from the Clearing Accounts to the Special Accounts will be made by Customs throughout the fiscal year. Transfers will occur between a Clearing Account and a Special Fund Account when an entry upon which antidumping or countervailing duties are owed is properly liquidated pursuant to an order, finding or receipt of liquidation instructions;</P>
            <P>(iii) The amount transferred at liquidation to the Special Account will be dependent upon the amount actually collected on the entry and in the Clearing Account. Following liquidation, additional transfers will be made on the liquidated entry to the corresponding Special Account, as additional antidumping or countervailing duties are collected.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Refunds resulting from reliquidation or court action.</E> If any of the underlying entries composing a prior distribution should reliquidate for a refund, such refund will be recovered from the corresponding Special Account. Similarly, refunds to importers resulting from any court action involving those entries will also be recovered from the corresponding Special Account. Refunds to importers will not be delayed pending the recovery of overpayments from domestic producers as set out in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Overpayments to affected domestic producers.</E> Overpayments to affected domestic producers resulting from subsequent reliquidations and/or court actions and determined by Customs to be not otherwise recoverable from the corresponding Special Account as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section will be collected from the affected domestic producers. The amount of each affected domestic producer's bill will be directly proportional to the total dumping and subsidy offset amounts that the affected domestic producer previously received under the related Special Account. All available collection methods will be used by Customs to collect outstanding bills, including but not limited to, administrative offset. Interest at the same rate set out at § 24.3a(c) of this chapter will begin to accrue on unpaid bills 30 days from the bill date.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment of certified claims.</E> (1) If the total amount of the certified net claims filed by affected domestic producers does not exceed the amount of the offset available for distribution in the corresponding Special Account, the certified net claim for each affected domestic producer will be paid in full.</P>
            <P>(2) If the certified net claims exceed the dumping and subsidy offset amount available in the corresponding Special Account, such offset will be made on a pro rata basis based on each affected domestic producer's total certified claim.</P>
            <P>(3) In any case where the distribution is not for the entire certified qualifying expenditure submitted by an affected domestic producer, and if the affected domestic producer believes that the reduction was the result of clerical error or mistake by Customs, it must file a request for reconsideration within 30 calendar days to the address given in the notification. After considering the matter, the Customs Service will notify the party requesting reconsideration of its decision. However, any adjustments will be made only from funds remaining in the account for that case in the current or future fiscal years, and will be paid prior to any future distributions.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Final distribution and termination of the Special Account.</E> (1) A Special Account will be terminated and a final distribution will occur when:</P>
            <P>(i) The order or finding with respect to which the account was established has terminated; and</P>
            <P>(ii) All entries relating to the order or finding are liquidated, all outstanding amounts collected or properly accounted for by Customs, all related protests, petitions, and court actions fully concluded, and all refunds due to importers on the underlying entries are paid in full.</P>
            <P>(2) Once the requirements set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section have been met, notice of a final distribution will be issued pursuant to § 159.62.</P>
            <P>(3) Amounts not timely claimed under the notice of final distribution will be permanently deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Interest on Special Accounts and Clearing Accounts.</E> In accordance with <PRTPAGE P="253"/>Federal appropriations law, and Treasury guidelines on Special Accounts, funds in such accounts are not interest-bearing unless specified by Congress. Likewise, funds being held in Clearing Accounts are not interest-bearing unless specified by Congress. Therefore, no interest will accrue in these accounts. However, statutory interest charged on antidumping and countervailing duties at liquidation will be transferred to the Special Account, when collected from the importer.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Distribution final and conclusive.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c)(3) of this section, any distribution made to an affected domestic producer under this section shall be final and conclusive on the affected domestic producer.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Annual report; disclosure of information.</E> Although it is not mandated in the law (19 U.S.C. 1675c), Customs will issue an annual report on the disbursements. This report will be available to the public via the Customs website. The annual report will address any initiatives that have been implemented to improve the liquidation and disbursement process. In addition, the annual report will include the information described in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Company-specific information.</E> The annual report will include the following information concerning those parties that have submitted certifications for a distribution of the offset with respect to each order or finding as identified by its case number:</P>
            <P>(i) The name of the claimant;</P>
            <P>(ii) The total dollar amount claimed by that party on its certification; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The total dollar amount disbursed to that company by Customs.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">General information.</E> The annual report will include the following general information for each order or finding as identified by its case number:</P>
            <P>(i) The number of entries and dollar amounts in the clearing account at the beginning of each fiscal year;</P>
            <P>(ii) The number and amount of Customs re-liquidations during the fiscal year; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The dollar amounts remaining uncollected from Customs bills issued during the fiscal year.</P>

This paragraph does not authorize seizure when seizure or forfeiture is restricted by law or regulation (see, for example, § 162.75), nor does it authorize a remedy other than seizure when seizure or forfeiture is required by law or regulation. A receipt for seized property shall be given at the time of seizure to the person from whom the property is seized.</P>

The Government's remedy in such cases is limited to an action against the master or owner.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Maritime Administration vessels; exemption from penalty.</E> (1) When a vessel owned or chartered under bareboat charter by the Maritime Administration and operated for its account becomes liable for the payment of a penalty incurred for violation of the Customs revenue or navigation laws, clearance of the vessel shall not be withheld nor shall any proceedings be taken against the vessel itself looking to the enforcement of such liability.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Summary forfeiture of Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Controlled Substances Act (84 Stat. 1242, 21 U.S.C. 801 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) provides that all controlled substances in Schedule I and Schedule II (as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802(6) and 812) that are possessed, transferred, sold or offered for sale in violation of the Act will be deemed contraband, seized and summarily forfeited to the United States (21 U.S.C. 881(f)). The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) incorporates by reference this contraband forfeiture provision of 21 U.S.C. 881. See 21 U.S.C. 965. Accordingly, in the case of a seizure of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer or his designee will contact the appropriate Drug Enforcement Administration official responsible for issuing permits authorizing the importation of such substances (see 21 CFR part 1312). If upon inquiry the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer or his designee is notified that no permit for lawful importation has been issued, he will declare the seized substances contraband and forfeited pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 881(f). Inasmuch as such substances are Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances, the notice procedures set forth in § 162.45 are inapplicable. When seized controlled substances are required as evidence in a court proceeding, they will be preserved to the extent and in the quantities necessary for that purpose.</P>

            <P>(3) Specifies the material false statements, omissions or acts including an explanation as to how and when they occurred; and</P>

            <P>(4) Sets forth, to the best of the disclosing party's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data that should have been provided in the entry or drawback claim documents, and states that the disclosing party will provide any information or data unknown at the time of disclosure within <PRTPAGE P="274"/>30 days of the initial disclosure date. Extensions of the 30-day period may be requested by the disclosing party from the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer to enable the party to obtain the information or data.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Tender of actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue.</E> A person who discloses the circumstances of the violation shall tender any actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue. The disclosing party may choose to make the tender either at the time of the claimed prior disclosure, or within 30 days after CBP notifies the person in writing of CBP calculation of the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may extend the 30-day period if there is good cause to do so. The disclosing party may request that the basis for determining CBP asserted actual loss of duties, taxes or fees be reviewed by Headquarters, provided that the actual loss of duties, taxes or fees determined by CBP exceeds $100,000 and is deposited with CBP, more than 1 year remains under the statute of limitations involving the shipments covered by the claimed disclosure, and the disclosing party has complied with all other prior disclosure regulatory provisions. A grant of review is within the discretion of CBP Headquarters in consultation with the appropriate field office, and such Headquarters review shall be limited to determining issues of correct tariff classification, correct rate of duty, elements of dutiable value, and correct application of any special rules (GSP, CBI, HTS 9802, etc.). The concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall forward appropriate review requests to the Chief, Penalties Branch, Office of International Trade. After Headquarters renders its decision, the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer will be notified and the concerned Center director will recalculate the loss, if necessary, and notify the disclosing party of any actual loss of duties, taxes or fees increases. Any increases must be deposited within 30 days, unless the local CBP office authorizes a longer period. Any reductions of the CBP calculated actual loss of duties, or and fees shall be refunded to the disclosing party. Such Headquarters review decisions are final and not subject to appeal. Further, disclosing parties requesting and obtaining such a review waive their right to contest either administratively or judicially the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue finally calculated by CBP under this procedure. Failure to tender the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue finally calculated by CBP shall result in denial of the prior disclosure.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effective time and date of prior disclosure</E>—(1) If the documents that provide the disclosing information are sent by registered or certified mail, return-receipt requested, and are received by Customs, the disclosure shall be deemed to have been made at the time of mailing.</P>
            <P>(2) If the documents are sent by other methods, including in-person delivery, the disclosure shall be deemed to have been made at the time of receipt by Customs. If the documents are delivered in person, the person delivering the documents will, upon request, be furnished a receipt from Customs stating the time and date of receipt.</P>
            <P>(3) The provision of information that is not in writing but that qualifies for prior disclosure treatment pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be deemed to have occurred at the time that Customs was provided with information that substantially complies with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Addressing and filing prior disclosure</E>—(1) A written prior disclosure should be addressed to the Commissioner of Customs, have conspicuously printed on the face of the envelope the words “prior disclosure,” and be presented to a Customs officer at the Customs port of entry of the disclosed violation.</P>

            <P>(2) In the case of a prior disclosure involving violations at multiple ports of entry, the disclosing party may orally disclose or provide copies of the disclosure to all concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officers. In accordance with internal Customs procedures, the officers will then seek consolidation of the disposition and handling of the disclosure. In the event <PRTPAGE P="275"/>that the claimed “multi-port” disclosure is made to a Customs officer other than the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, the disclosing party must identify all ports involved to enable the concerned Customs officer to refer the disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for consolidation of the proceedings.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Verification of disclosure.</E> Upon receipt of a prior disclosure, the Customs officer shall notify Customs Office of Investigations of the disclosure. In the event the claimed prior disclosure is made to a Customs officer other than the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, it is incumbent upon the Customs officer to provide a copy of the disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer. The disclosing party may request, in the oral or written prior disclosure, that the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer request that the Office of Investigations withhold the initiation of disclosure verification proceedings until after the party has provided the information or data within the time limits specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. It is within the discretion of the concerned Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures Officer to grant or deny such requests.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Commencement of a formal investigation.</E> A formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received that caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation existed. In the event that a party affirmatively asserts a prior disclosure (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, identified or labeled as a prior disclosure) and is denied prior disclosure treatment on the basis that Customs had commenced a formal investigation of the disclosed violation, and Customs initiates a penalty action against the disclosing party involving the disclosed violation, a copy of a “writing” evidencing the commencement of a formal investigation of the disclosed violation shall be attached to any required prepenalty notice issued to the disclosing party pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Scope of the disclosure and expansion of a formal investigation.</E> A formal investigation is deemed to have commenced as to additional violations not included or specified by the disclosing party in the party's original prior disclosure on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received that caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of such additional violations existed. Additional violations not disclosed or covered within the scope of the party's prior disclosure that are discovered by Customs as a result of an investigation and/or verification of the prior disclosure shall not be entitled to treatment under the prior disclosure provisions.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation</E>—(1) A disclosing party who claims lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden to prove that lack of knowledge. A person shall be presumed to have had knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation of a violation if before the claimed prior disclosure of the violation a formal investigation has been commenced and:</P>
            <P>(i) Customs, having reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a, so informed the person of the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A Customs Special Agent, having properly identified himself or herself and the nature of his or her inquiry, had, either orally or in writing, made an inquiry of the person concerning the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or</P>
            <P>(iii) A Customs Special Agent, having properly identified himself or herself and the nature of his or her inquiry, requested specific books and/or records of the person relating to the disclosed violation; or</P>

            <P>(iv) Customs issues a prepenalty or penalty notice to the disclosing party pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a relating to the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or<PRTPAGE P="276"/>
            </P>
            <P>(v) The merchandise that is the subject of the disclosure was seized; or</P>
            <P>(vi) In the case of violations involving merchandise accompanying persons entering the United States or commercial merchandise inspected in connection with entry, the person has received oral or written notification of Customs finding of a violation.</P>
            <P>(2) The presumption of knowledge may be rebutted by evidence that, notwithstanding the foregoing notice, inquiry or request, the person did not have knowledge that an investigation had commenced with respect to the disclosed information.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Prior disclosure using sampling.</E> (1) A private party may use statistical sampling to “disclose the circumstances of a violation” and for calculation of lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue for purposes of prior disclosure, provided that the statistical sampling satisfies the criteria in 19 CFR 163.11(c)(3). The prior disclosure must include an explanation of the sampling plan and methodology that meets with CBP's approval. The time period, scope, and any sampling plan employed by the private party, as well as the execution and results of the self-review, are subject to CBP review and approval. In accordance with 19 CFR 163.11(c)(1), in circumstances where the private party and CBP have discussed and accepted the sampling plan and its methodology, or adjustments to it, the private party submitting a prior disclosure employing sampling under this paragraph may not contest the validity of the sampling plan or its methodology, and challenges of the sampling itself will be limited to computational and clerical errors after CBP conducts its review and makes a determination. This is not a waiver of the private party's right to later contest substantive issues it may properly raise under applicable regulations, as provided in 19 CFR 163.11(c)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) If a private party submits a prior disclosure claim employing sampling, CBP may review other transactions from the same time period and scope that are the subject of the prior disclosure.</P>

            <P>Whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed under this subpart, the appropriate Customs field officer will require the deposit of any actual loss of duties, taxes and fees resulting from a violation of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592) or any actual loss of revenue resulting from a violation of section 593A, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1593a), notwithstanding that the liquidation of the entry to which the loss is attributable has become final. If a person is liable for the payment of actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue in any case in which a monetary penalty is not assessed or a written notification of claim of monetary penalty is not issued, the port director will issue a written notice to the person of the liability for the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue. The notice will identify the merchandise and entries involved, state the loss of duties, taxes and fees or loss of revenue and how it was calculated, and require the person to deposit or arrange for payment of the duties, taxes and fees or revenue within 30 days from the date of the notice. Any determination of actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue under this section is subject to <PRTPAGE P="280"/>review upon written application to the Commissioner of Customs.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Methods for storage of records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Original records.</E> All persons listed in § 163.2 must maintain all records required by law and regulation for the required retention periods and as original records, whether paper or electronic, unless alternative storage methods have been adopted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The records, whether in their original format or under an alternative storage method, must be capable of being retrieved upon lawful request or demand by CBP.<PRTPAGE P="287"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Alternative method of storage</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Any of the persons listed in § 163.2 may maintain any records, other than records required to be maintained as original records under laws and regulations administered by other Federal government agencies, in an alternative format, provided that the person gives advance written notification of such alternative storage method to the Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Dr., Charlotte, North Carolina 28217, and provided further that the Director of Regulatory Audit, Charlotte office does not instruct the person in writing as provided herein that certain described records may not be maintained in an alternative format. The written notice to the Director of Regulatory Audit, Charlotte office must be provided at least 30 calendar days before implementation of the alternative storage method, must identify the type of alternative storage method to be used, and must state that the alternative storage method complies with the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If an alternative storage method covers records that pertain to goods under CBP seizure or detention or that relate to a matter that is currently the subject of an inquiry or investigation or administrative or court proceeding, the appropriate CBP office may instruct the person in writing that those records must be maintained as original records and therefore may not be converted to an alternative format until specific written authorization is received from that CBP office. A written instruction to a person under this paragraph may be issued during the 30-day advance notice period prescribed in this section or at any time thereafter, must describe the records in question with reasonable specificity but need not identify the underlying basis for the instruction, and shall not preclude application of the planned alternative storage method to other records not described therein.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Standards for alternative storage methods.</E> Methods commonly used in standard business practice for storage of records include, but are not limited to, machine readable data, CD ROM, and microfiche. Methods that are in compliance with generally accepted business standards will generally satisfy CBP requirements, provided that the method used allows for retrieval of records requested within a reasonable time after the request and provided that adequate provisions exist to prevent alteration, destruction, or deterioration of the records. The following standards must be applied by recordkeepers when using alternative storage methods:</P>
          <P>(i) Operational and written procedures are in place to ensure that the imaging and/or other media storage process preserves the integrity, readability, and security of the information contained in the original records. The procedures must include a standardized retrieval process for such records. Vendor specifications/documentation and benchmark data must be available for CBP review;</P>
          <P>(ii) There is an effective labeling, naming, filing, and indexing system;</P>
          <P>(iii) Except in the case of packing lists (<E T="03">see</E> § 163.4(b)(2)), entry records must be maintained by the importer in their original formats for a period of 120 calendar days from the end of the release or conditional release period, whichever is later, or, if a demand for return to CBP custody has been issued, for a period of 120 calendar days either from the date the goods are redelivered or from the date specified in the demand as the latest redelivery date if redelivery has not taken place. Customs brokers who are not serving as the importer of record and who maintain separate electronic records are exempted from this requirement. This exemption does not apply to any document that is required by law to be maintained as a paper record.</P>
          <P>(iv) An internal testing of the system must be performed on a yearly basis;</P>
          <P>(v) The recordkeeper must have the capability to make, and must bear the cost of, hard-copy reproductions of alternatively stored records that are required by CBP for audit, inquiry, investigation, or inspection of such records; and</P>

          <P>(vi) The recordkeeper must retain and keep available one working copy and one back-up copy of the records stored in a secure location for the required periods as provided in § 163.4.<PRTPAGE P="288"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Changes to alternative storage procedures.</E> No changes to alternative recordkeeping procedures may be made without first notifying the Director of Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina 28217. The notification must be in writing and must be provided to the director at least 30 calendar days before implementation of the change.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Penalties.</E> All persons listed in § 163.2 who use alternative storage methods for records and who fail to maintain or produce the records in accordance with this part are subject to penalties pursuant to § 163.6 for entry records or sanctions pursuant to §§ 163.9 and 163.10 for other records.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Failure to comply with alternative storage requirements.</E> If a person listed in § 163.2 uses an alternative storage method for records that is not in compliance with the conditions and requirements of this section, CBP may issue a written notice informing the person of the facts giving rise to the notice and directing that the alternative storage method must be discontinued in 30 calendar days unless the person provides written notice to the issuing CBP office within that time period that explains, to CBP's satisfaction, how compliance has been achieved. Failure to timely respond to CBP will result in CBP requiring discontinuance of the alternative storage method until a written statement explaining how compliance has been achieved has been received and accepted by CBP.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Production of entry records.</E> Pursuant to written, oral, or electronic notice, any Customs officer may require the production of entry records by any person listed in § 163.2(a) who is required under this part to maintain such records, even if the entry records were required at the time of entry. Any oral demand for entry records shall be followed by a written or electronic demand. The entry records shall be produced within 30 calendar days of receipt of the demand or within any shorter period as Customs may prescribe when the entry records are required in connection with a determination regarding the admissibility or release of merchandise. Should any person from whom Customs has demanded entry records encounter a problem in timely complying with the demand, such person may submit a written or electronic request to Customs for approval of a specific additional period of time in which to produce the records; the request must be received by Customs before the applicable due date for production of the records and must include an explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the request. Customs will promptly advise the requesting person electronically or in writing either that the request is denied or that the requested additional time period, or such shorter period as Customs may deem appropriate, is approved. The mere fact that a request for additional time to produce demanded entry records was submitted under this section shall not by itself preclude the imposition of a monetary penalty or other sanction under this part for failure to timely produce the records, but no such penalty or other sanction will be imposed if the request is approved and the records are produced before expiration of that additional period of time.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Failure to produce entry records</E>—(1) <E T="03">Monetary penalties applicable.</E> The following penalties may be imposed if a person fails to comply with a lawful demand for the production of an entry record and is not excused from a penalty pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section:</P>

          <P>(ii) If the failure to comply is a result of negligence of the person in maintaining, storing, or retrieving the demanded record, such person shall be <PRTPAGE P="289"/>subject to a penalty, for each release of merchandise, not to exceed $10,000, or an amount equal to 40 percent of the appraised value of the merchandise, whichever amount is less.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional actions</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> In addition to any penalty imposed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, if the demanded entry record relates to the eligibility of merchandise for a column 1 special rate of duty in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), the entry of such merchandise:</P>
          <P>(A) If unliquidated, shall be liquidated at the applicable HTSUS column 1 general rate of duty; or</P>
          <P>(B) If liquidated within the 2-year period preceding the date of the demand, shall be reliquidated, notwithstanding the time limitation in 19 U.S.C. 1514 or 1520, at the applicable HTSUS column 1 general rate of duty.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Any liquidation or reliquidation under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section shall be at the applicable HTSUS column 2 rate of duty if Customs demonstrates that the merchandise should be dutiable at such rate.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Avoidance of penalties.</E> No penalty may be assessed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the person who fails to comply with a lawful demand for entry records can show:</P>
          <P>(i) That the loss of the demanded record was the result of an act of God or other natural casualty or disaster beyond the fault of such person or an agent of the person;</P>
          <P>(ii) On the basis of other evidence satisfactory to Customs, that the demand was substantially complied with;</P>
          <P>(iii) That the record demanded was presented to and retained by Customs at the time of entry or submitted in response to an earlier demand; or</P>
          <P>(iv) That he has been certified as a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program (see § 163.12), that he is generally in compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements of that program, and that the violation in question is his first violation and was a non-willful violation.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Penalties not exclusive.</E> Any penalty imposed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law except for:</P>
          <P>(i) A penalty imposed under 19 U.S.C. 1592 for a material omission of any information contained in the demanded record; or</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents of notice.</E> The issuing officer shall ensure that any notice issued under this section includes a copy of the summons and provides the following information:</P>
          <P>(1) That compliance with the summons may be stayed if written direction not to comply with the summons is given by the person receiving notice to the person summoned;</P>
          <P>(2) That a copy of any such direction to not comply and a copy of the summons shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the person summoned and to the Customs officer who issued the summons; and</P>

          <P>Whenever a person does not comply with a Customs summons, the issuing officer may request the appropriate U.S. attorney to seek an order requiring compliance from the U.S. district <PRTPAGE P="292"/>court for the district in which the person is found or resides or is doing business.

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Monetary penalties.</E> The U.S. district court for any judicial district in which a person served with a Customs summons is found or resides or is doing business may order such person to comply with the summons. Upon the failure of a person to obey a court order to comply with a Customs summons, the court may find such person in contempt and may assess a monetary penalty.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Importations prohibited.</E> If a person fails to comply with a court order to comply with a Customs summons and is adjudged guilty of contempt, the Commissioner of Customs, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, for so long as that person remains in contempt:</P>

          <SUBJECT>Audit procedures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> In conducting an audit under 19 U.S.C. 1509(b), the CBP auditors, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, will:</P>
          <P>(1) Provide notice, telephonically and in writing, to the person to be audited of CBP's intention to conduct an audit and a reasonable estimate of the time to be required for the audit;</P>
          <P>(2) Inform the person who is to be the subject of the audit, in writing and before commencement of the audit, of that person's right to an entrance conference, at which time the objectives and records requirements of the audit, and any sampling plan to be employed or offsetting that may apply, will be explained and the estimated termination date of the audit will be set. Where a decision on a sampling plan and methodology is not made at the time of the entrance conference, CBP will discuss these matters with the person being audited as soon as possible after the discovery of facts and circumstances that warrant the possible need to employ sampling;</P>
          <P>(3) Provide a further estimate of any additional time for the audit if, during the course of the audit, it becomes apparent that additional time will be required;</P>
          <P>(4) Schedule a closing conference upon completion of the audit on-site work to explain the preliminary results of the audit;</P>
          <P>(5) Complete a formal written audit report within 90 calendar days following the closing conference referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, unless the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, provides written notice to the person audited of the reason for any delay and the anticipated completion date; and</P>
          <P>(6) After application of any disclosure exemptions contained in 5 U.S.C. 552, send a copy of the formal written audit report to the person audited within 30 calendar days following completion of the report.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Petition procedures for failure to conduct closing conference.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if the estimated or actual termination date of the audit passes without a CBP auditor providing a closing conference to explain the results of the audit, the person audited may petition in writing for a closing conference to the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. <PRTPAGE P="293"/>Upon receipt of the request, the director will provide for the closing conference to be held within 15 calendar days after the date of receipt.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of statistical sampling in calculation of loss of duties or revenue</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> In conducting an audit under this section, regardless of the finality of liquidation under 19 U.S.C. 1514, CBP auditors have the sole discretion to determine the time period and scope of the audit and will examine a sufficient number of transactions, as determined solely by CBP. In addition to examining all transactions to identify loss of duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592 or loss of revenue under 19 U.S.C. 1593a, or to determine compliance with any other applicable customs laws or other laws enforced by CBP, CBP auditors, at their sole discretion, may use statistical sampling methods. During the audit, CBP auditors will explain the sampling plan and how the results of the sampling will be projected over the universe of transactions for purposes of calculating lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue and, where appropriate, overpayments and over-declarations eligible for offsetting under paragraph (d) of this section. The person being audited and CBP will discuss the specifics of the sampling plan before audit work under the plan is commenced. Once the sampling plan is accepted, the audited person waives the ability to contest the validity of the sampling plan or its methodology at a later date and challenges of the sampling will be limited to challenging computational and clerical errors. CBP's authority to conduct the audit or employ statistical sampling is not dependent on the audited person's acceptance of the specifics of the sampling plan. An audited person's acceptance of the sampling plan and methodology must be in writing and signed by a management official with authority to bind the company in matters of trade, imports, and/or other affairs under the customs laws, CBP regulations, or other applicable laws. The audited person may submit the signed waiver to the CBP auditor. The appropriate field director, Regulatory Audit, will sign the waiver for CBP. Where the sampling plan or methodology is subsequently adjusted or modified, at CBP's discretion, acceptance of the adjustments or modifications also must be in writing and signed. This is not a waiver of the audited person's right to later contest substantive issues, such as misclassification, undervaluation, etc., that may properly be raised under applicable regulations, including in a request for CBP Headquarters advice under 19 CFR 171.14, a request for CBP Headquarters review under 19 CFR 162.74(c), a response to a prepenalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(1) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(1), a petition submitted in response to a penalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(2) (19 CFR part 171) and 19 U.S.C. 1618, a supplemental petition submitted under 19 CFR 171.61 and 171.62, or any action commenced in a court of proper jurisdiction.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Projection.</E> For purposes of this section, “projection” of sampling results over the universe of transactions is the process by which the results obtained from the sample entries actually examined are applied to the universe of entries set within the time period and scope of the sampling plan to yield a reliable assessment of that which is sought to be ascertained or measured in the audit, including, but not limited to, lost duties or revenue, or overpayments or over-declarations, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">When CBP uses statistical sampling.</E> CBP auditors have the sole discretion to use statistical sampling techniques when:</P>
          <P>(i) Review of 100 percent of the transactions is impossible or impractical;</P>
          <P>(ii) The sampling plan is prepared in accordance with generally recognized sampling procedures; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The sampling procedure is executed in accordance with that plan.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Statistical sampling by audited persons under CBP supervision.</E> CBP may authorize a person being audited to conduct, under CBP supervision, self-testing of its own transactions within the time period and scope of the audit as originally set or later modified by CBP at its discretion. Audited persons permitted in advance by CBP to conduct self-testing of certain transactions under CBP supervision within <PRTPAGE P="294"/>the time period and scope of a CBP audit may use statistical sampling methods, provided that the criteria contained in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. CBP will determine the time period and scope of the CBP-approved and supervised self-testing and will explain any sampling plan to be employed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The execution and results of the self-testing and the sampling plan are subject to CBP approval, and the audited person is subject to the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Statistical sampling by a private party submitting a prior disclosure.</E> A private party conducting an independent review of certain transactions and a calculation of lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue for purposes of prior disclosure, in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74(j), may use statistical sampling, provided that the private party submits an explanation of the sampling plan and methodology employed and that the criteria in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. Where the private party submits a prior disclosure employing statistical sampling, the time period, scope, and any sampling plan employed by the private party, as well as the execution and results of the self-review, are subject to CBP review and approval. Where CBP and the private party discuss and accept the sampling plan and methodology, or an adjustment to it, the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Offset of overpayments and over-declarations in 19 U.S.C. 1592 penalty cases</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> In conducting any audit authorized under 19 U.S.C. 1509 and this section for the purpose of calculating the loss of duties, taxes, and fees or monetary penalty under any provision of 19 U.S.C. 1592, CBP auditors identifying overpayments of duties or fees or over-declarations of quantities or values that are within the time period and scope of the audit, as established solely by CBP, will treat the overpayments or over-declarations on finally liquidated entries as an offset to any underpayments or under-declarations also identified on finally liquidated entries, provided that:</P>
          <P>(i) The identified overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the person being audited for the purpose of violating any provision of law, including laws other than customs laws,</P>
          <P>(ii) The identified underpayments or under-declarations were not made knowingly and intentionally, and</P>
          <P>(iii) All other requirements of this paragraph (d) are met.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">When audited person conducts self-testing under CBP supervision.</E> Offsetting will apply to self-testing conducted by an audited person under CBP supervision (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, during a CBP audit), provided that all requirements of this paragraph (d) are met, CBP approves the self-testing in advance and, upon review of the self-testing, CBP approves its execution and results.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">When a private party submits a prior disclosure.</E> Offsetting will apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure, provided that the prior disclosure is in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74 and CBP approves the private party's self-review, including its execution and results. CBP's Office of International Trade, Regulatory Audit will review and evaluate all such prior disclosures and approve offsetting where it is satisfied that the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1509(b)(6) and this paragraph (d) are met.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Time period and scope determined by CBP; projection when sampling employed.</E> In conducting an audit under paragraph (d)(1) of this section or authorizing an audited person's self-testing as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CBP will have the sole authority to determine the time period and scope of the audit. In conducting a review of a private party's prior disclosure as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the time period and scope employed will be subject to CBP approval. In each of these circumstances, where statistical sampling is involved, CBP auditors will examine only the selected sample transactions. The results of the sample examination, with respect to properly identified overpayments and over-declarations and properly identified underpayments and under-declarations, will be projected over the universe of transactions to determine the total overpayments and over-declarations that are eligible for <PRTPAGE P="295"/>offsetting and to determine the total loss of duties, taxes, and fees.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Same acts, statements, omissions, or entries not required.</E> Offsetting may be permitted where the overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the same acts, statements, or omissions that caused the underpayments or under-declarations, and is not limited to the same entries that evidence the underpayments or under-declarations, provided that they are within the time period and scope of the audit as established by CBP and as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to specific overpayments or over-declarations made for the purpose of violating any provision of law, including laws other than customs laws. Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to overpayments or over-declarations resulting from a failure to timely claim or establish a duty allowance or preference. Offsetting will be disallowed entirely where CBP determines that any underpayments or under-declarations identified for offsetting purposes were made knowingly and intentionally.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Audit report.</E> Where overpayments or over-declarations have been identified in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the audit report will state whether they have been made within the time period and scope of the audit.</P>
          <P>(8) <E T="03">Disallowance determinations referred to Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures office.</E> Any determination that offsets will be disallowed where overpayments/over-declarations were made for the purpose of violating any law, or where underpayments or under-declarations were made knowingly and intentionally, will be made by the appropriate Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures (FP&amp;F) office to which the issue was referred. CBP will notify the audited person of a determination whether to allow offsetting in whole or in part. The FP&amp;F office will issue a notice of penalty under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b) and/or notice of liability for lost duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592(d) where it determines that such action is warranted. If the FP&amp;F office issues a notice of penalty, the audited person may file a petition under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2), 19 U.S.C. 1618, and 19 CFR part 171 to challenge the action.</P>
          <P>(9) <E T="03">Refunds limited.</E> An overpayment of duties and fees will only be credited toward a refund if the circumstances of the overpayment meet the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1520 or the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1514(a) pertaining to clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence in any entry, liquidation, or reliquidation.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Sampling not evidence of reasonable care.</E> The fact that entries were previously within the time period and scope of an audit conducted by CBP in which sampling was employed, in any circumstances described in this section, is not evidence of reasonable care by a violator in any subsequent action involving such entries.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Exception to procedures.</E> The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may not apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(6), (b), (d)(8), and (d)(9) of this section do not apply once CBP and/or ICE commences an investigation with respect to the issue(s) involved.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Recordkeeping Compliance Program.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Recordkeeping Compliance Program is a voluntary CBP program under which certified recordkeepers may be eligible for alternatives to penalties (see paragraph (d) of this section) that might be assessed under § 163.6 for failure to produce a demanded entry record. However, even where a certified recordkeeper is eligible for an alternative to a penalty, participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program has no limiting effect on the authority of CBP to use a summons, court order or other legal process to compel the production of records by that certified recordkeeper.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Who may apply.</E> Any person described in § 163.2(a) who is required to maintain and produce entry records under this part may apply to participate in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Where to apply.</E> An application for certification to participate in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program must be submitted to the Regulatory Audit, <PRTPAGE P="296"/>U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Dr., Charlotte, North Carolina 28217. The application must be submitted in accordance with the guidelines contained in the CBP Recordkeeping Compliance Handbook which may be obtained by downloading it from CBP's Regulatory Audit Web site located at <E T="03">http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/import/regulatory_audit_program/archive/compliance_assessment/</E> or by writing to the Recordkeeping Compliance Program, Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20229.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Certification requirements.</E> A recordkeeper may be certified as a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program after meeting the general recordkeeping requirements established under this section or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the recordkeeper and CBP. To be certified, a recordkeeper must be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. CBP will take into account the size and nature of the importing business and the volume of imports and CBP workload constraints prior to granting certification. In order to be certified, a recordkeeper must meet the applicable requirements set forth in the CBP Recordkeeping Compliance Handbook and must be able to demonstrate that it:</P>
          <P>(i) Understands the legal requirements for recordkeeping, including the nature of the records required to be maintained and produced and the time periods relating thereto;</P>
          <P>(ii) Has in place procedures to explain the recordkeeping requirements to those employees who are involved in the preparation, maintenance and production of required records;</P>
          <P>(iii) Has in place procedures regarding the preparation and maintenance of required records, and the production of such records to CBP;</P>
          <P>(iv) Has designated a dependable individual or individuals to be responsible for recordkeeping compliance under the program and whose duties include maintaining familiarity with the recordkeeping requirements of CBP;</P>
          <P>(v) Has a record maintenance procedure acceptable to CBP for original records or has an alternative records maintenance procedure adopted in accordance with § 163.5(b); and</P>
          <P>(vi) Has procedures for notifying CBP of any occurrence of a variance from, or violation of, the requirements of the Recordkeeping Compliance Program or negotiated alternative program, as well as procedures for taking corrective action when notified by CBP of violations or problems regarding such program. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “variance” means a deviation from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program that does not involve a failure to maintain or produce records or a failure to meet the requirements set forth in this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “violation” means a deviation from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program that involves a failure to maintain or produce records or a failure to meet the requirements set forth in this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Application review and approval and certification process</E>—(1) <E T="03">Review of applications.</E> The Charlotte regulatory audit field office will process the application and will coordinate and consult, as may be necessary, with the appropriate CBP Headquarters and field officials. The Charlotte regulatory audit field office will review and verify the information contained in the application and may initiate an on-site verification prior to approval and certification. If an on-site visit is warranted, the Charlotte regulatory audit field office will inform the applicant. If additional information is necessary to process the application, the applicant will be notified. CBP requests for information not submitted with the application or for additional explanation of details will cause a delay in the application approval and certification of applicants and may result in the suspension of the application approval and certification process until the requested information is received by CBP.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Approval and certification.</E> If, upon review, CBP determines that the application should be approved and that certification should be granted, the Director of the Charlotte regulatory audit field office will issue the certification <PRTPAGE P="297"/>with all the applicable conditions stated therein.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternatives to penalties</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> If a certified participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program does not produce a demanded entry record for a specific release or provide the information contained in the demanded entry record by acceptable alternate means, CBP will, in lieu of a monetary penalty provided for in § 163.6(b), issue a written notice of violation to the person as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, provided that the certified participant is generally in compliance with the procedures and requirements of the program and provided that the violation was not a willful violation and was not a repeat violation. A willful failure to produce demanded entry records or repeated failures to produce demanded entry records may result in the issuance of penalties under § 163.6(b) and removal of certification under the program (see § 163.13) until corrective action satisfactory to CBP is taken.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Contents of notice.</E> A notice of violation issued to a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program for failure to produce a demanded entry record or information contained therein must:</P>
          <P>(i) State that the recordkeeper has violated the recordkeeping requirements;</P>
          <P>(ii) Identify the record or information which was demanded and not produced;</P>
          <P>(iii) Warn the recordkeeper that future failures to produce demanded entry records or information contained therein may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and could result in the removal of the recordkeeper from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Response to notice.</E> Within a reasonable time after receiving written notice under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the recordkeeper must notify CBP of the steps it has taken to prevent a recurrence of the violation.</P>

          <P>(1) Denial of certification for program participation in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(2) Removal of certification for program participation in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Denial of certification for program participation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grounds for denial.</E> Customs may deny an application for certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program for any of the following reasons:</P>
          <P>(i) The applicant fails to meet the requirements set forth in § 163.12(b)(3);</P>
          <P>(ii) A circumstance involving the applicant arises that would justify initiation of a certification removal action under paragraph (c) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(iii) In the judgment of Customs, the applicant appears not to be in compliance with Customs laws and regulations.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Denial procedure.</E> If the Director of the Miami regulatory audit field office determines that an application submitted under § 163.12 should not be approved and that certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program should not be granted, the Director shall issue a written notice of denial to the applicant. The notice of denial shall set forth the reasons for the denial and shall advise the applicant of its right to file an appeal of the denial in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification removal</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grounds for removal.</E> The certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program by a certified recordkeeper may be removed when any of the following conditions are discovered:</P>
          <P>(i) The certification privilege was obtained through fraud or mistake of fact;</P>

          <P>(2) <E T="03">Removal procedure.</E> If Customs determines that the certification of a program participant should be removed, the Director of the Miami regulatory audit field office shall serve the program participant with written notice of the removal. Such notice shall inform the program participant of the grounds for the removal and shall advise the program participant of its right to file an appeal of the removal in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of removal.</E> The removal of certification shall be effective immediately in cases of willfulness on the part of the program participant or when required by public health, interest, or safety. In all other cases, the removal of certification shall be effective when the program participant has received notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and either no appeal has been filed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or all appeal procedures thereunder have been concluded by a decision that upholds the removal action. Removal of certification may subject the affected person to penalties.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Appeal of certification denial or removal</E>—(1) <E T="03">Appeal of certification denial.</E> A person may challenge a denial of an application for certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program by filing a written appeal with the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. The appeal must be received by the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, within 30 calendar days after issuance of the notice of denial. The Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, will review the appeal and will respond with a written decision within 30 calendar days after receipt of the appeal unless circumstances require a delay in issuance of the decision. If the decision cannot be issued within the 30-day period, the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, will advise the appellant of the reasons for the delay and of any further actions which will be carried out to complete the appeal review and of the anticipated date for issuance of the appeal decision.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Appeal of certification removal.</E> A certified recordkeeper who has received a CBP notice of removal of certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program may challenge the removal by filing a written appeal with the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229.

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Part 163—Interim (<E T="01">a</E>)(1)(A) List</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">List of Records Required for the Entry of Merchandise</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">General Information</HD>
          <P>(1) Section 508 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1508), sets forth the general recordkeeping requirements for Customs-related activities. Section 509 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1509) sets forth the procedures for the production and examination of those records (which includes, but is not limited to, any statement, declaration, document, or electronically generated or machine readable data).</P>

          <P>(2) Section 509(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by title VI of Public Law 103-182, commonly referred to as the Customs Modernization Act (19 U.S.C. 1509(a)(1)(A)), requires the production, within a reasonable time after demand by the Customs Service is made (taking into consideration the number, type and age of the item <PRTPAGE P="299"/>demanded) if “such record is required by law or regulation for the entry of the merchandise (whether or not the Customs Service required its presentation at the time of entry).” Section 509(e) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by Public Law 103-182 (19 U.S.C. 1509(e)) requires the Customs Service to identify and publish a list of the records and entry information that is required to be maintained and produced under subsection (a)(1)(A) of section 509 (19 U.S.C. 1509(a)(1)(A)). This list is commonly referred to as “the (a)(1)(A) list.”</P>
          <P>(3) The Customs Service has tried to identify all the presently required entry information or records on the following list. However, as automated programs and new procedures are introduced, these may change. In addition, errors and omissions to the list may be discovered upon further review by Customs officials or the trade. Pursuant to section 509(g), the failure to produce listed records or information upon reasonable demand may result in penalty action or liquidation or reliquidation at a higher rate than entered. A recordkeeping penalty may not be assessed if the listed information or records are transmitted to and retained by Customs.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Other recordkeeping requirements:</E> The importing community and Customs officials are reminded that the (a)(1)(A) list only pertains to records or information required for the entry of merchandise. An owner, importer, consignee, importer of record, entry filer, or other party who imports merchandise, files a drawback claim or transports or stores bonded merchandise, any agent of the foregoing, or any person whose activities require them to file a declaration or entry, is also required to make, keep and render for examination and inspection records (including, but not limited to, statements, declarations, documents and electronically generated or machine readable data) which pertain to any such activity or the information contained in the records required by the Tariff Act in connection with any such activity, and are normally kept in the ordinary course of business. While these records are not subject to administrative penalties, they are subject to examination and/or summons by Customs officers. Failure to comply could result in the imposition of significant judicially imposed penalties and denial of import privileges.</P>
          <P>(5) The following list does not replace entry requirements, but is merely provided for information and reference. In the case of the list conflicting with regulatory or statutory requirements, the latter will govern.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">List of Records and Information Required for the Entry of Merchandise</HD>

          <P>The following records (which include, but are not limited to, any statement, declaration, document, or electronically generated or machine readable data) are required by law or regulation for the entry of merchandise and are required to be maintained and produced to Customs upon reasonable demand (whether or not Customs required their presentation at the time of entry). Information may be submitted to Customs at the time of entry in a Customs authorized electronic or paper format. Not every entry of merchandise requires all of the following information. Only those records or information applicable to the entry requirements for the merchandise in question will be required/mandatory. The list may be amended as Customs reviews its requirements and continues to implement the Customs Modernization Act. When a record or information is filed with and retained by Customs, the record is not subject to recordkeeping penalties, although the underlying backup or supporting information from which it is obtained may also be subject to the general record retention regulations and examination or summons pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508 and 1509. (All references, unless otherwise indicated, are to the current edition of title 19, Code of Federal Regulations, as amended by subsequent <E T="04">Federal Register</E> documents.)</P>

          <P>This part relates to allegations by the public and requests from Federal agencies for an investigation regarding the evasion of antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders and the procedures by which CBP investigates such claims consistent with the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA), which contains Title IV-Prevention of Evasion of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Orders (short title “Enforce and Protect Act of 2015” or “EAPA”) (Pub. L. 114-125, 130 Stat. 122, 155, Feb. 24, 2016) (19 U.S.C. 4301 note). This part includes the requirements for the filing of allegations and requests for investigations, the investigation procedures, and administrative review of determinations as to evasion of AD/CVD orders under the EAPA. The procedures under this part are not the exclusive manner by which CBP may receive allegations or requests for an investigation from Federal agencies or investigate such allegations or requests with respect to the evasion of AD/CVD orders. An investigation as described in this part, if initiated by CBP, does not preclude CBP or any other government entity from initiating any other investigation or proceeding pursuant to any other provision of law, including proceedings initiated under 19 U.S.C. 1592.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Public version.</E> An interested party filing a submission containing claimed business confidential information must also file a public version of the submission. The public version must be filed on the same date as the business confidential version and contain a summary of the bracketed information in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the <PRTPAGE P="306"/>information.

            <P>(iii) Submit other material concerning the subject matter in lieu of the rejected information.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Information that will not be protected as confidential.</E> The following information provided by a party to the investigation in an allegation of evasion will not be protected as business confidential information and will be treated as public pursuant to the certification of informed consent referenced in § 165.11(c):</P>
            <P>(1) Name of the party to the investigation providing the information and identification of the agent filing on its behalf, if any, and email address for communication and service purposes;</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Information placed on the record by CBP.</E> Any information that CBP places on the administrative record, when obtained other than from an interested party subject to the requirements of this section, will include a public summary of the business confidential information as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, when applicable.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance with CBP time limits</E>—(1) <E T="03">Requests for extensions.</E> CBP may, for good cause, extend any regulatory time limit if a party requests an extension in a separate, stand-alone submission and states the reasons for the request. Such requests must be submitted no less than three business days before the time limit expires unless there are extraordinary circumstances. An extraordinary circumstance is an unexpected event that could not have been prevented even if reasonable measures had been taken. It is within CBP's reasonable discretion to determine what constitutes extraordinary circumstances, what constitutes good cause, and to grant or deny a request for an extension.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rejection of untimely submissions.</E> If a submission is untimely filed, then CBP will not consider or retain it in the administrative record and adverse inferences may be applied, if applicable.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the party to the investigation that filed an allegation, the importer, or the foreign producer or exporter of the covered merchandise fails to cooperate and comply to the best of its ability with a request for information made by CBP, CBP may apply an inference adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available to make the determination as to evasion pursuant to § 165.27 and subpart D of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Other adverse inferences.</E> CBP may also apply an inference adverse to the interests of a party based on a prior determination in another CBP investigation, proceeding, or action that involves evasion with respect to AD/CVD orders, or any other available information.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Application.</E> An adverse inference described in this section may be used with respect to the importer of the covered merchandise, or the foreign producer or exporter of the covered merchandise without regard to whether another party involved in the same transaction or transactions under examination has provided the information sought by CBP, such as import or export documentation.</P>

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Small businesses.</E> Small businesses are entitled to technical assistance upon request. In general, small businesses are eligible to make such requests if they have neither adequate internal resources nor financial ability to obtain qualified outside assistance in preparing and submitting for CBP's consideration allegations of evasion.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Multiple allegations against one or more importers may be consolidated into a single investigation at CBP's discretion. Consolidations may be made at any point prior to the issuance of a determination as to evasion with respect to a particular importer. If multiple allegations are received and consolidated prior to the initiation of an investigation, then the date of receipt of the first properly filed allegation will start the time period for the deadline to initiate the investigation described in § 165.15 with respect to that allegation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> CBP may consolidate multiple allegations if warranted based on the consideration of certain factors. The factors that CBP may consider include, but are not limited to, whether the multiple allegations involve:</P>
            <P>(1) Relationships between the importers;</P>
            <P>(2) Similarity of covered merchandise;</P>
            <P>(3) Similarity of AD/CVD orders; and</P>
            <P>(4) Overlap in time periods for entries of covered merchandise.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice.</E> Notice of consolidation will be promptly transmitted to all parties to the investigation if consolidation occurs at a point in the investigation after which they have already been notified of the ongoing investigation. Otherwise, parties will be notified no later than 95 calendar days after the date of initiation of the investigation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Service requirements for other parties to the investigation.</E> Upon notification of consolidation, parties to the consolidated investigation must serve via an email message or through any other method approved or designated by CBP upon the newly added parties to the investigation the public versions of any documents that were previously served upon parties to the unconsolidated investigation. Service must take place within five business days of the notice of consolidation.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requests for investigations.</E> Any other Federal agency, including the Department of Commerce or the United States International Trade Commission, may request an investigation under this part. CBP will initiate an investigation if the Federal agency has provided information that reasonably suggests that an importer has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion, unless the agency submits a request to withdraw to the designated email address specified by CBP.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Contents of requests.</E> The following information must be included in the request for an investigation:</P>
            <P>(1) Name of importer against whom the allegation is brought;</P>
            <P>(2) Description of the covered merchandise;</P>
            <P>(3) Applicable AD/CVD orders;</P>

            <P>(6) Notification of any knowledge of or reason to suspect that the covered merchandise poses any health or safety risk to U.S. consumers.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Receipt of requests.</E> Requests for an investigation must be filed electronically via CBP's online e-Allegations system or through any other method approved or designated by CBP. The date of receipt is the date that CBP transmits notice of the assigned control number to the Federal agency that filed the request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of release of information</E>—(1) <E T="03">Public information.</E> CBP will treat the information required by paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section as public information.</P>

Therefore, it will neither receive official notice of developments after CBP's receipt of the request for an investigation nor will it receive service of any documents filed by interested parties. Only the parties to the investigation will be entitled to notice and service, as well as the related rights to administrative review and judicial review.</P>

            <P>(1) <E T="03">Clerical error.</E> A clerical error, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1517(a)(5)(B), is not evasion, although CBP will take appropriate actions to ensure that AD/CVD duties are assessed and collected.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Withdrawal.</E> An allegation or a request for an investigation from another Federal agency may be withdrawn pursuant to the requirements of § 165.12(b) or § 165.14(a), as applicable.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification of the investigation.</E> If CBP determines that it will not initiate an investigation, it will notify the interested party who filed the allegation within five business days of that determination. Otherwise, the parties to the investigation will be notified consistent with the following time limits:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> CBP will issue notification of its decision to initiate an investigation to all parties to the investigation no later than 95 calendar days after the decision has been made, and the actual date of initiation will be specified therein. However, notification to all parties to the investigation will occur no later than five business days after interim measures are taken pursuant to § 165.24.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Consolidated allegations.</E> If multiple allegations are consolidated, any interested party who filed an allegation after initiation of an investigation will be notified by CBP of the date of the decision to initiate an investigation when that party receives notice of consolidation under § 165.13(c).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application and definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> The following definitions, regulations, and criteria are designed to establish and implement procedures required by section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, title VI (102 Stat. 4181). They are intended to supplement existing law and procedures relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified statutory authority. The provisions of these regulations do not affect the existing legal and equitable rights and remedies of those with an interest in property seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions relieve interested parties from their existing obligations and responsibilities in pursuing their interests through such courses of action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intent of Congress to minimize the adverse impact occasioned by the prolonged detention of property subject to forfeiture due to violations of law involving possession of personal use quantities of controlled substances. The definition of personal use quantities of controlled substance as contained herein is intended to distinguish between those quantities small in amount which are generally considered to be possessed for personal consumption and not for distribution, and those larger quantities generally considered to be subject to distribution.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meanings specified:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Appraised value.</E> “Appraised value” has the meaning given in § 162.43(a) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Commercial fishing industry vessel.</E> “Commercial fishing industry vessel” means a vessel that:</P>

            <P>(i) Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish <PRTPAGE P="321"/>or an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;</P>
            <P>(ii) Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by gutting, decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or brine chilling; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports fish, fish products, or materials directly related to fishing or the preparation of fish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel or fish processing facility.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Controlled substance.</E> “Controlled substance” has the meaning given in 21 U.S.C. 802.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Normal and customary manner.</E> “Normal and customary manner” means that inquiry suggested by particular facts and circumstances which would customarily be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual in a like or similar situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and circumstances is unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive knowledge is sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is persuasive but not conclusive or controlling in determining whether a petitioner acted in a normal and customary manner to ascertain how property would be used by another legally in possession of the property.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Owner or interested party.</E> “Owner or interested party” means one having a legal and possessory interest in the property seized for foreiture or one who was in legal possession of the property at the time of seizure and is entitled to legal possession at the time of granting the petition for expedited procedure. This includes a lienholder, to the extent of his interest in the property, whose claim is in writing (except for a maritime lien which need not be in writing), unless the collateral is in the possession of the secured party. The agreement securing such a lien must create or provide for a security interest in the collateral, describe the collateral and be signed by the debtor.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Personal use quantities.</E> “Personal use quantities” means possession of controlled substances in circumstances where there is no evidence of intent to distribute, or to facilitate the manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing or exporting of any controlled substance. A quantity of a controlled substance is presumed to be for personal use if the amounts possessed do not exceed the quantities set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section if there is no evidence of illicit drug trafficking or distribution such as, but not limited to the factors set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. The possession of a narcotic, a depressant, a stimulant, a hallucinogin or a cannabis-controlled substance will be considered in excess of personal use quantities if the dosage unit amount possessed provides the same or greater equivalent efficacy as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Quantities presumed to be for personal use unless evidence of illicit drug trafficking or distribution exists.</E> (A) One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of heroin;</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quantity of any of the substances referred to in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(B) (<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>) of this section;</P>
            <P>(C) <FR>1/10</FR>th gram of a mixture of substances described in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(B) of this section which contains cocaine base;</P>
            <P>(D) <FR>1/10</FR>th gram of mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of phencyclidine (PCP);</P>
            <P>(E) 500 micrograms of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);</P>
            <P>(F) One ounce of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of marihuana; or</P>

            <P>(G) One gram of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers, or one gram of a mixture of substances containing a detectable <PRTPAGE P="322"/>amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Evidence of possession for other than personal use.</E> Quantities shall not be considered to be for personal use if sweepings are present or there is other evidence of possession for other than personal use such as:</P>
            <P>(A) Evidence such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia, drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug “cutting” agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to process, package or distribute a controlled substance;</P>
            <P>(B) Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute;</P>
            <P>(C) The arrest and/or conviction record of the person or persons in actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for offenses under Federal, State or local law that indicates an intent to distribute a controlled substance;</P>
            <P>(D) The controlled substance is related to large amounts of cash or any amount of prerecorded government funds;</P>
            <P>(E) The controlled substance is possessed under circumstances that indicate such a controlled substance is a sample intended for distribution in anticipation of a transaction involving large quantities, or is part of a larger delivery; or</P>
            <P>(F) Statements by the possessor, or otherwise attributable to the possessor, including statements of conspirators, that indicate possession with intent to distribute.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Property.</E> “Property” means property subject to forfeiture under 19 U.S.C. 1595a.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Seizing agency.</E> “Seizing agency” means the Federal agency which has seized the property or adopted the seizure of another agency, and has the responsibility for administratively forfeiting the property.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Sworn to.</E> “Sworn to” refers to the oath as provided by 28 U.S.C. 1746 or as notarized in accordance with state law.</P>

However, where property is seized for administrative forfeiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1595a due to violations involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, a petition may be filed pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to seek expedited procedures for release of the property. A petition filed pursuant to this subpart shall also serve as a petition for relief filed under subpart B of this part. The petition may be filed by an owner or interested party.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Commercial fishing industry vessels.</E> Where a commercial fishing industry vessel proceeding to or from a fishing area or intermediate port of call or actually engaged in fishing operations is subject to seizure for administrative forfeiture for a violation of law involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, a summons to appear shall be issued in lieu of a physical seizure. The vessel shall report to the port designated in the summons no later than the date specified in the summons. When a commercial fishing industry vessel reports, the appropriate Customs officer shall, depending on the facts and circumstances, either issue another summons to appear at a time deemed appropriate, execute a constructive seizure agreement pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1605, or take physical custody of the vessel. When a summons to appear has been issued, the seizing agency may be authorized to institute administrative forfeiture as if the vessel had been physically seized. When a summons to appear has been issued, the owner or interested party may file a petition for expedited procedures pursuant to subsection (a); the provisions of subsection (a) and other provisions in this subpart relating to a petition for expedited release shall apply as if the vessel had been physically seized.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Elements to be established in petition.</E> (1) The petition for expedited procedures shall establish that:<PRTPAGE P="323"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The petitioner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized property as owner or otherwise;</P>
            <P>(ii) The petitioner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the property in a normal and customary manner; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The petitioner did not know or consent to the illegal use of the property or, in the event that the petitioner knew or should have known of the illegal use, the petitioner did what reasonably could be expected to prevent the violation.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition, the petitioner may submit evidence to establish that he has statutory rights or defenses such that he would prevail in a judicial proceeding on the issue of forfeiture.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Manner of filing.</E> A petition for expedited procedures must be filed in a timely manner to be considered by Customs. To be filed in a timely manner, the petition must be received by Customs within 20 days from the date the notice of seizure was mailed, or in the case of a commercial fishing industry vessel for which a summons to appear is issued, 20 days from the original date when the vessel is required to report. The petition must be sworn to by the petitioner and signed by the petitioner or his attorney at law. If the petitioner is a corporation, the petition may be sworn to by an officer or responsible supervisory employee thereof and signed by that individual or an attorney at law representing the corporation. Both the envelope and the request must be clearly marked “PETITION FOR EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.” The petition shall be addressed to the U.S. Customs Service and filed in triplicate with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for the port where the property was seized, or for commercial fishing industry vessels, with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for the port to which the vessel was required to report.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Contents of petition.</E> The petition shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A complete description of the property, including identification numbers, if any, and the date and place of the violation and seizure;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the petitioner's interest in the property, supported by the documentation, bills of sale, contracts, mortgages, or other satisfactory documentary evidence; and</P>
            <P>(3) A statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the petitioner to justify expedited return of the seized property, supported by satisfactory evidence.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 171—Guidelines for Disposition of Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1497</HD>
            <P>Liabilities incurred under section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1497), shall be mitigated or remitted in accordance with the following guidelines (see also part 148, Customs Regulations):</P>
            <P>I. <E T="03">Violations Involving Dutiable Articles.</E> For violations involving articles subject to duty and for which there is no applicable exemption from duty, the following rules apply:</P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Mitigated Penalty for First Offense.</E> For violations which are the first offense, where there is knowledge of the declaration requirements, and where the undeclared articles are discovered by the Customs officers, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of Three Times the Duty (but not less than $50), or the domestic value, whichever is lower.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Mitigating Factors.</E> When one or more of the following mitigating factors are present, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of Between One and One-Half and Three Times the Duty or the domestic value, whichever is lower:</P>
            <P>a. Communications with the violator are impaired because of language barrier, mental condition, or physical ailment;</P>
            <P>b. Violator cooperates with Customs officers after discovery of the violation by providing additional information which facilitates conclusion of the case;</P>
            <P>c. Violator is an inexperienced traveler;</P>
            <P>d. There is contributory Customs error (for example, violator demonstrates he was given incorrect advice by a Customs officer).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Aggravating Factors.</E> When one or more of the following aggravating factors are present, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of Between Three and Six Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic value, whichever is lower:</P>
            <P>a. Documentary or other evidence discovered establishes violator's intent;</P>
            <P>b. Informant provides information which tends to establish violator's intent and leads to discovery of the violation after the violator has been given an opportunity to properly declare;</P>
            <P>c. Violator is an experienced traveler;</P>
            <P>d. Undeclared articles are concealed to evade U.S. law;</P>
            <P>e. There is behavior, including extreme lack of cooperation, verbal or physical abuse, or attempted escape, which tends to demonstrate a lack of respect for law and authority.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Commercial Articles.</E> When the undeclared articles are brought in for commercial purposes, the liabilities shall be remitted upon the payment of Six Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic value, whichever is lower. Mitigating factors may be used to lower this amount to as little as Three Times the Duty; aggravating factors may be used to increase this amount up to Eight Times the Duty.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Extraordinary Mitigating Factor.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. When an individual who has been cleared through Customs without discovery of any undeclared article returns to the examination area and declares that article, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of One Times the Duty.</P>
            <P>b. An individual who declares articles some time later (hours, days, weeks, etc.) may be treated similarly.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Extraordinary Aggravating Factors.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. When the offense is a second or subsequent violation, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of Between Six and Eight Times the Duty (but not less than $250), or the domestic value, whichever is lower.</P>
            <P>b. When the offense is a second or subsequent violation, and there are aggravating factors present, generally there shall either be a denial of relief or mitigation to No Less Than Eight Times the Duty or the domestic value, whichever is lower.</P>
            <P>c. When there is evidence of an ongoing scheme to defraud the revenue involving multiple entries without declaration of articles subject to declaration, the deciding officer shall act in accordance with the preceding paragraph.</P>
            <P>II. <E T="03">Violations Involving Absolutely or Conditionally Free Articles.</E> For violations involving <PRTPAGE P="326"/>articles either entitled to entry free of duty absolutely (classifiable under a duty-free provision in Chapters 1-97, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); (19 U.S.C. 1202)), or entry free of duty conditionally (entitled to treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (see §§ 10.171-10.178, Customs Regulations) or Chapter 98, HTSUS), the following rules apply:</P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Mitigated Penalty for First Offense.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. For violations which are first offense, and involve articles entitled to the benefit of GSP or Chapter 98, HTSUS, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of One Times the Duty which would have been due if the articles had not been entitled to the benefit.</P>
            <P>b. For violations which are first offense, and involve absolutely duty-free articles, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of Between One and Five Percent of the Domestic Value, but not less than $50 (or the domestic value, whichever is less) nor more than $1,000.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Mitigating Factors.</E> When mitigating factors such as those outlined above are present, the deciding officer may, in his discretion, reduce the mitigated amount to a lower figure.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Aggravating Factors.</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. When aggravating factors such as those outlined above are present, the deciding officer may, in his discretion, remit the liabilities for conditionally free articles upon the payment of Between One and Two Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic value, whichever is lower.</P>
            <P>b. For absolutely free articles, the deciding officer may remit the liabilities upon payment of Between Five and Ten Percent of the Domestic Value, but not less than $100.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Commercial Merchandise.</E>
            </P>
            <P>The fact that undeclared duty-free articles are imported for commercial purposes may be considered an aggravating factor under section II.3. of these guidelines.</P>
            <P>III. <E T="03">Other Applicable Rules.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. These guidelines provide a framework and procedure by which violations of 19 U.S.C. 1497 are to be analyzed. They are not mandatory in the sense that they must be absolutely applied. Customs officers varying from these guidelines must provide reasons for doing so in the case record.</P>
            <P>2. Customs officers shall document mitigating and aggravating factors found in each case in the case file. There must be a basis shown for mitigated amounts.</P>
            <P>3. It is intended that mitigating and aggravating factors shall be considered together and used to offset each other where appropriate.</P>
            <P>4. The rate of duty to be used in calculating the mitigated penalty shall be the appropriate rate from Chapters 1-97, HTSUS, and not the flat rate from Chapter 98, HTSUS.</P>
            <P>5. “Duty” means Customs duties and any internal revenue taxes which would have attached upon importation (see section 101.1(i), Customs Regulations). Therefore, multiples will also be applied to internal revenue taxes which would have been due.</P>
            <P>6. Customs officers may, within their discretion, consider other factors not here delineated as aggravating or mitigating and apply the guidelines accordingly. These additional factors must also be documented in the case file.</P>
            <P>7. These guidelines are not authority for admitting into the commerce of the United States articles which are conditionally or absolutely prohibited from entry.</P>
            <P>8. The presence of one or more extraordinary aggravating factors, including but not limited to those set forth in section I.6. of these guidelines, may within the discretion of the deciding officer be a basis for denial of relief.</P>

            <P>9. If the violator is being prosecuted criminally, the civil (19 U.S.C. 1497) liability generally is administratively settled only after completion of the prosecution or with the express approval of the appropriate U.S. attorney. Criminal prosecution of the violator, however, is insufficient grounds to delay indefinitely determination of the civil liability. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer should contact the Chief Counsel representative in the field to determine the best course of action to follow with respect to the civil liability. Chief Counsel representative will consult with the U.S. attorney and the Penalties Branch at Customs Headquarters. Because of time delay problems, all <E T="03">seizures</E> involving criminal prosecutions must be promptly coordinated in this manner, and consideration should be given to immediate referral of the forfeiture action to the U.S. attorney for the institution of a judicial proceeding.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 171—Customs Regulations, Guidelines for the Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1592</HD>

            <P>A monetary penalty incurred under section 592 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592; hereinafter referred to as section 592) may be remitted or mitigated under section 618 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618), if it is determined that there are mitigating circumstances to justify remission or mitigation. The guidelines below will be used by the Customs Service in arriving at a just and reasonable assessment and <PRTPAGE P="327"/>disposition of liabilities arising under section 592 within the stated limitations. It is intended that these guidelines shall be applied by Customs officers in pre-penalty proceedings and in determining the monetary penalty assessed in any penalty notice. The assessed penalty or penalty amount set forth in Customs administrative disposition determined in accordance with these guidelines does not limit the penalty amount which the Government may seek in bringing a civil enforcement action pursuant to section 592(e). It should be understood that any mitigated penalty is conditioned upon payment of any actual loss of duty as well as a release by the party that indicates that the mitigation decision constitutes full accord and satisfaction. Further, mitigation decisions are not rulings within the meaning of part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 177). Lastly, these guidelines may supplement, and are not intended to preclude application of, any other special guidelines promulgated by Customs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(A) Violations of Section 592</HD>
            <P>Without regard to whether the United States is or may be deprived of all or a portion of any lawful duty, tax or fee thereby, a violation of section 592 occurs when a person, through fraud, gross negligence, or negligence, enters, introduces, or attempts to enter or introduce any merchandise into the commerce of the United States by means of any document, electronic transmission of data or information, written or oral statement, or act that is material and false, or any omission that is material; or when a person aids or abets any other person in the entry, introduction, or attempted entry or introduction of merchandise by such means. It should be noted that the language “entry, introduction, or attempted entry or introduction” encompasses placing merchandise in-bond (e.g., filing an immediate transportation application). There is no violation if the falsity or omission is due solely to clerical error or mistake of fact, unless the error or mistake is part of a pattern of negligent conduct. Also, the unintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error generally will not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct. Nevertheless, if Customs has drawn the party's attention to the unintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error, subsequent failure to correct the error could constitute a violation of section 592. Also, the unintentional repetition of a clerical mistake over a significant period of time or involving many entries could indicate a pattern of negligent conduct and a failure to exercise reasonable care.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(B) Definition of Materiality Under Section 592</HD>
            <P>A document, statement, act, or omission is material if it has the natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing agency action including, but not limited to a Customs action regarding: (1) Determination of the classification, appraisement, or admissibility of merchandise (e.g., whether merchandise is prohibited or restricted); (2) determination of an importer's liability for duty (including marking, antidumping, and/or countervailing duty); (3) collection and reporting of accurate trade statistics; (4) determination as to the source, origin, or quality of merchandise; (5) determination of whether an unfair trade practice has been committed under the anti-dumping or countervailing duty laws or a similar statute; (6) determination of whether an unfair act has been committed involving patent, trademark, or copyright infringement; or (7) the determination of whether any other unfair trade practice has been committed in violation of federal law. The “but for” test of materiality is inapplicable under section 592.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(C) Degrees of Culpability Under Section 592</HD>
            <P>The three degrees of culpability under section 592 for the purposes of administrative proceedings are:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Negligence.</E> A violation is determined to be negligent if it results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done through either the failure to exercise the degree of reasonable care and competence expected from a person in the same circumstances either: (a) in ascertaining the facts or in drawing inferences therefrom, in ascertaining the offender's obligations under the statute; or (b) in communicating information in a manner so that it may be understood by the recipient. As a general rule, a violation is negligent if it results from failure to exercise reasonable care and competence: (a) to ensure that statements made and information provided in connection with the importation of merchandise are complete and accurate; or (b) to perform any material act required by statute or regulation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Gross Negligence.</E> A violation is deemed to be grossly negligent if it results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done with actual knowledge of or wanton disregard for the relevant facts and with indifference to or disregard for the offender's obligations under the statute.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Fraud.</E> A violation is determined to be fraudulent if a material false statement, omission, or act in connection with the transaction was committed (or omitted) knowingly, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> was done voluntarily and intentionally, as established by clear and convincing evidence.<PRTPAGE P="328"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(D) Discussion of Additional Terms</HD>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Duty Loss Violations.</E> A section 592 duty loss violation involves those cases where there has been a loss of duty including any marking, anti-dumping, or countervailing duties, or any tax and fee (e.g., merchandise processing and/or harbor maintenance fees) attributable to an alleged violation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-duty Loss Violations.</E> A section 592 non-duty loss violation involves cases where the record indicates that an alleged violation is principally attributable to, for example, evasion of a prohibition, restriction, or other non-duty related consideration involving the importation of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Actual Loss of Duties.</E> An actual loss of duty occurs where there is a loss of duty including any marking, anti-dumping, or countervailing duties, or any tax and fee (e.g., merchandise processing and/or harbor maintenance fees) attributable to a liquidated Customs entry, and the merchandise covered by the entry has been entered or introduced (or attempted to be entered or introduced) in violation of section 592.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Potential Loss of Duties.</E> A potential loss of duty occurs where an entry remains unliquidated and there is a loss of duty, including any marking, anti-dumping or countervailing duties or any tax and fee (e.g., merchandise processing and/or harbor maintenance fees) attributable to a violation of section 592, but the violation was discovered prior to liquidation. In addition, a potential loss of duty exists where Customs discovers the violation and corrects the entry to reflect liquidation at the proper classification and value. In other words, the potential loss in such cases equals the amount of duty, tax and fee that would have occurred had Customs not discovered the violation prior to liquidation and taken steps to correct the entry.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Total Loss of Duty.</E> The total loss of duty is the sum of any actual and potential loss of duty attributable to alleged violations of section 592 in a particular case. Payment of any actual and/or potential loss of duty shall not affect or reduce the total loss of duty used for assessing penalties as set forth in these guidelines. The “multiples” set forth below in paragraph (F)(2) involving assessment and disposition of cases shall utilize the “total loss of duty” amount in arriving at the appropriate assessment or disposition.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Reasonable Care.</E> General Standard: All parties, including importers of record or their agents, are required to exercise reasonable care in fulfilling their responsibilities involving entry of merchandise. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to: providing a classification and value for the merchandise; furnishing information sufficient to permit Customs to determine the final classification and valuation of merchandise; taking measures that will lead to and assure the preparation of accurate documentation, and determining whether any applicable requirements of law with respect to these issues are met. In addition, all parties, including the importer, must use reasonable care to provide accurate information or documentation to enable Customs to determine if the merchandise may be released. Customs may consider an importer's failure to follow a binding Customs ruling a lack of reasonable care. In addition, unreasonable classification will be considered a lack of reasonable care (e.g., imported snow skis are classified as water skis). Failure to exercise reasonable care in connection with the importation of merchandise may result in imposition of a section 592 penalty for fraud, gross negligence or negligence.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Clerical Error.</E> A clerical error is an error in the preparation, assembly or submission of import documentation or information provided to Customs that results from a mistake in arithmetic or transcription that is not part of a pattern of negligence. The mere non-intentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligence. Nevertheless, as stated earlier, if Customs has drawn a party's attention to the non-intentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error, subsequent failure to correct the error could constitute a violation of section 592. Also, the unintentional repetition of a clerical mistake over a significant period of time or involving many entries could indicate a pattern of negligent conduct and a failure to exercise reasonable care.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Mistake of Fact.</E> A mistake of fact is a false statement or omission that is based on a bona fide erroneous belief as to the facts, so long as the belief itself did not result from negligence in ascertaining the accuracy of the facts.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(E) Penalty Assessment</HD>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Case Initiation—Pre-penalty Notice.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> As provided in § 162.77, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.77), if the appropriate Customs field officer has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 592 has occurred and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs field officer will issue to each person concerned a notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the “pre-penalty notice”). In issuing such a pre-penalty notice, the Customs field officer will make a tentative determination of the degree of culpability and the amount of the proposed claim. Payment of any actual and/or potential loss of duty will not affect or reduce the total loss of duty used for assessing penalties as set forth in these guidelines. The “multiples” set forth in paragraphs (F)(2)(a)(i), (b)(i) and (c)(i) involving assessment and disposition of duty loss violation cases will use <PRTPAGE P="329"/>the amount of total loss of duty in arriving at the appropriate assessment or disposition. Further, where separate duty loss and non-duty loss violations occur on the same entry, it is within the Customs field officer's discretion to assess both duty loss and non-duty loss penalties, or only one of them. Where only one of the penalties is assessed, the Customs field officer has the discretion to select which penalty (duty loss or non-duty loss) shall be assessed. Also, where there is a violation accompanied by an incidental or nominal loss of duties, the Customs field officer may assess a non-duty loss penalty where the incidental or nominal duty loss resulted from a separate non-duty loss violation. The Customs field officer will propose a level of culpability in the pre-penalty notice that conforms to the level of culpability suggested by the evidence at the time of issuance. Moreover, the pre-penalty notice will include a statement that it is Customs practice to base its actions on the earliest point in time that the statute of limitations may be asserted (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the date of occurrence of the alleged violation) inasmuch as the final resolution of a case in court may be less than a finding of fraud. A pre-penalty notice that is issued to a party in a case where Customs determines a claimed prior disclosure is not valid—owing to the disclosing party's knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation of a disclosed violation—will include a copy of a written document that evidences the commencement of a formal investigation. In addition, a pre-penalty notice is not required if a violation involves a non-commercial importation or if the proposed claim does not exceed $1,000. Special guidelines relating to penalty assessment and dispositions involving “Arriving Travelers,” are set forth in section (L) below.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Pre-penalty Notice—Proposed Claim Amount</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Fraud.</E> In general, if a violation is determined to be the result of fraud, the proposed claim ordinarily will be assessed in an amount equal to the domestic value of the merchandise. Exceptions to assessing the penalty at the domestic value may be warranted in unusual circumstances such as a case where the domestic value of the merchandise is disproportionately high in comparison to the loss of duty attributable to an alleged violation (e.g., a total loss of duty of $10,000 involving 10 entries with a total domestic value of $2,000,000). Also, it is incumbent upon the appropriate Customs field officer to consider whether mitigating factors are present warranting a reduction in the customary domestic value assessment. In all section 592 cases of this nature regardless of the dollar amount of the proposed claim, the Customs field officer will obtain the approval of the Penalties Branch at Headquarters prior to issuance of a pre-penalty notice at an amount less than domestic value.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Gross Negligence and Negligence.</E> In determining the amount of the proposed claim in cases involving gross negligence and negligence, the appropriate Customs field officer will take into account the gravity of the offense, the amount of loss of duty, the extent of wrongdoing, mitigating or aggravating factors, and other factors bearing upon the seriousness of a violation, but in no case will the assessed penalty exceed the statutory ceilings prescribed in section 592. In cases involving gross negligence and negligence, penalties equivalent to the ceilings stated in paragraphs (F)(2)(b) and (c) regarding disposition of cases may be appropriate in cases involving serious violations, e.g., violations involving a high loss of duty or significant evasion of import prohibitions or restrictions. A “serious” violation need not result in a loss of duty. The violation may be serious because it affects the admissibility of merchandise or the enforcement of other laws, as in the case of quota evasions, false statements made to conceal the dumping of merchandise, or violations of exclusionary orders of the International Trade Commission.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Technical Violations.</E> Violations where the loss of duty is nonexistent or minimal and/or that have an insignificant impact on enforcement of the laws of the United States may justify a proposed penalty in a fixed amount not related to the value of merchandise, but an amount believed sufficient to have a deterrent effect: e.g., violations involving the subsequent sale of merchandise or vehicles entered for personal use; violations involving failure to comply with declaration or entry requirements that do not change the admissibility or entry status of merchandise or its appraised value or classification; violations involving the illegal diversion to domestic use of instruments of international traffic; and local point-to-point traffic violations. Generally, a penalty in a fixed amount ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 is appropriate in cases where there are no prior violations of the same kind. However, fixed sums ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 may be appropriate in the case of multiple or repeated violations. Fixed sum penalty amounts are not subject to further mitigation and may not exceed the maximum amounts stated in section 592 and in these guidelines.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Statute of Limitations Considerations—Waivers.</E> Prior to issuance of any section 592 pre-penalty notice, the appropriate Customs field officer will calculate the statute of limitations attributable to an alleged violation. Inasmuch as section 592 cases are reviewed de novo by the Court of International Trade, the statute of limitations calculation in cases alleging fraud should assume a level of culpability of gross negligence or negligence, <PRTPAGE P="330"/>
              <E T="03">i.e.,</E> ordinarily applying a shorter period of time for statute of limitations purposes. In accordance with section 162.78 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.78), if less than 1 year remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense, a shortened response time may be specified in the notice—but in no case, less than 7 business days from the date of mailing. In cases of shortened response times, the Customs field officer should notify alleged violators by telephone and use all reasonable means (e.g., facsimile transmission of a copy of the notice) to expedite receipt of the notice by the alleged violators. Also in such cases, the appropriate Customs field officer should advise the alleged violator that additional time to respond to the pre-penalty notice will be granted only if an acceptable waiver of the statute of limitations is submitted to Customs. With regard to waivers of the statute of limitations, it is Customs practice to request waivers concurrently both from all potential alleged violators and their sureties.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Closure of Case or Issuance of Penalty Notice.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Case Closure.</E> The appropriate Customs field officer may find, after consideration of the record in the case, including any pre-penalty response/oral presentation, that issuance of a penalty notice is not warranted. In such cases, the Customs field officer will provide written notification to the alleged violator who received the subject pre-penalty notice that the case is closed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Issuance of Penalty Notice.</E> In the event that circumstances warrant issuance of a notice of penalty pursuant to § 162.79 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.79), the appropriate Customs field officer will give consideration to all available evidence with respect to the existence of material false statements or omissions (including evidence presented by an alleged violator), the degree of culpability, the existence of a prior disclosure, the seriousness of the violation, and the existence of mitigating or aggravating factors. In cases involving fraud, the penalty notice will be in the amount of the domestic value of the merchandise unless a lesser amount is warranted as described in paragraph (E)(1)(b)(i). In general, the degree of culpability or proposed penalty amount stated in a pre-penalty notice will not be increased in the penalty notice. If, subsequent to the issuance of a pre-penalty notice and upon further review of the record, the appropriate Customs field officer determines that a higher degree of culpability exists, the original pre-penalty notice should be rescinded and a new pre-penalty notice issued that indicates the higher degree of culpability and increased proposed penalty amount. However, if less than 9 months remain before expiration of the statute of limitations or any waiver thereof by the party named in the pre-penalty notice, the higher degree of culpability and higher penalty amount may be indicated in the notice of penalty without rescinding the earlier pre-penalty notice. In such cases, the Customs field officer will consider whether a lower degree of culpability is appropriate or whether to change the information contained in the pre-penalty notice.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Statute of Limitations Considerations.</E> Prior to issuance of any section 592 penalty notice, the appropriate Customs field officer again shall calculate the statute of limitations attributable to the alleged violation and request a waiver(s) of the statute, if necessary. In accordance with part 171 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 171), if less than 180 days remain before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense, a shortened response time may be specified in the notice—but in no case less than 7 business days from the date of mailing. In such cases, the Customs field officer should notify an alleged violator by telephone and use all reasonable means (e.g., facsimile transmission of a copy) to expedite receipt of the penalty notice by the alleged violator. Also, in such cases, the Customs field officer should advise an alleged violator that, if an acceptable waiver of the statute of limitations is provided, additional time to respond to the penalty notice may be granted.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(F) Administrative Penalty Disposition</HD>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Generally.</E> It is the policy of the Department of the Treasury and the Customs Service to grant mitigation in appropriate circumstances. In certain cases, based upon criteria to be developed by Customs, mitigation may take an alternative form, whereby a violator may eliminate or reduce his or her section 592 penalty liability by taking action(s) to correct problems that caused the violation. In any case, in determining the administrative section 592 penalty disposition, the appropriate Customs field officer will consider the entire case record—taking into account the presence of any mitigating or aggravating factors. All such factors should be set forth in the written administrative section 592 penalty decision. Once again, Customs emphasizes that any penalty liability which is mitigated is conditioned upon payment of any actual loss of duty in addition to that penalty as well as a release by the party that indicates that the mitigation decision constitutes full accord and satisfaction. Finally, section 592 penalty dispositions in duty-loss and non-duty-loss cases will proceed in the manner set forth below.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Dispositions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Fraudulent Violation.</E> Penalty dispositions for a fraudulent violation will be calculated as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Duty Loss Violation.</E> An amount ranging from a minimum of 5 times the total loss of duty to a maximum of 8 times the total loss of duty—but in any such case the amount <PRTPAGE P="331"/>may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise. A penalty disposition greater than 8 times the total loss of duty may be imposed in a case involving an egregious violation, or a public health and safety violation, or due to the presence of aggravating factors, but again, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Non-Duty Loss Violation.</E> An amount ranging from a minimum of 50 percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 80 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise. A penalty disposition greater than 80 percent of the dutiable value may be imposed in a case involving an egregious violation, or a public health and safety violation, or due to the presence of aggravating factors, but the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grossly Negligent Violation.</E> Penalty dispositions for a grossly negligent violation shall be calculated as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Duty Loss Violation.</E> An amount ranging from a minimum of 2.5 times the total loss of duty to a maximum of 4 times the total loss of duty—but in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Non-Duty Loss Violation.</E> An amount ranging from a minimum of 25 percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 40 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise—but in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Negligent Violation.</E> Penalty dispositions for a negligent violation shall be calculated as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Duty Loss Violation.</E> An amount ranging from a minimum of 0.5 times the total loss of duty to a maximum of 2 times the total loss of duty but, in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Non-Duty Loss Violation.</E> An amount ranging from a minimum of 5 percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 20 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise, but, in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Authority to Cancel Claim.</E> Upon issuance of a penalty notice, Customs has set forth its formal monetary penalty claim. Except as provided in 19 CFR part 171, in those section 592 cases within the administrative jurisdiction of the concerned Customs field office, the appropriate Customs field officer will cancel any such formal claim whenever it is determined that an essential element of the alleged violation is not established by the agency record, including pre-penalty and penalty responses provided by the alleged violator. Except as provided in 19 CFR part 171, in those section 592 cases within Customs Headquarters jurisdiction, the appropriate Customs field officer will cancel any such formal claim whenever it is determined that an essential element of the alleged violation is not established by the agency record, and such cancellation action precedes the date of the Customs field officer's receipt of the alleged violator's petition responding to the penalty notice. On and after the date of Customs receipt of the petition responding to the penalty notice, jurisdiction over the action rests with Customs Headquarters including the authority to cancel the claim.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Remission of Claim.</E> If the Customs field officer believes that a claim for monetary penalty should be remitted for a reason not set forth in these guidelines, the Customs field officer should first seek approval from the Chief, Penalties Branch, Customs Service Headquarters.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Prior Disclosure Dispositions.</E> It is the policy of the Department of the Treasury and the Customs Service to encourage the submission of valid prior disclosures that comport with the laws, regulations, and policies governing this provision of section 592. Customs will determine the validity of the prior disclosure including whether or not the prior disclosure sets forth all the required elements of a violation of section 592. A valid prior disclosure warrants the imposition of the reduced Customs civil penalties set forth below:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Fraudulent Violation.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Duty Loss Violation.</E> The claim for monetary penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of the total loss of duty (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> actual + potential) resulting from the violation. No mitigation will be afforded.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-Duty Loss Violation.</E> The claim for monetary penalty shall be equal to 10 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise in question. No mitigation will be afforded.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Gross Negligence and Negligence Violation.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Duty Loss Violation.</E> The claim for monetary penalty shall be equal to the interest on the actual loss of duty computed from the date of liquidation to the date of the party's tender of the actual loss of duty resulting from the violation. Customs notes that there is no monetary penalty in these cases if the duty loss is potential in nature. Absent extraordinary circumstances, no mitigation will be afforded.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-Duty Loss Violation.</E> There is no monetary penalty in such cases and any claim for monetary penalty which had been issued prior to the decision granting prior disclosure will be remitted in full.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(G) Mitigating Factors</HD>
            <P>The following factors will be considered in mitigation of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or the amount of the administrative penalty decision, provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not all-inclusive.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Contributory Customs Error.</E> This factor includes misleading or erroneous advice given by a Customs official <E T="03">in writing</E> to the <PRTPAGE P="332"/>alleged violator, or established by a contemporaneously created written Customs record, only if it appears that the alleged violator reasonably relied upon the information and the alleged violator fully and accurately informed Customs of all relevant facts. The concept of comparative negligence may be utilized in determining the weight to be assigned to this factor. If it is determined that the Customs error was the sole cause of the violation, the proposed or assessed penalty claim shall be canceled. If the Customs error contributed to the violation, but the violator also is culpable, the Customs error will be considered as a mitigating factor.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Cooperation with the Investigation.</E> To obtain the benefits of this factor, the violator must exhibit extraordinary cooperation beyond that expected from a person under investigation for a Customs violation. Some examples of the cooperation contemplated include assisting Customs officers to an unusual degree in auditing the books and records of the violator (e.g., incurring extraordinary expenses in providing computer runs solely for submission to Customs to assist the agency in cases involving an unusually large number of entries and/or complex issues). Another example consists of assisting Customs in obtaining additional information relating to the subject violation or other violations. Merely providing the books and records of the violator should not be considered cooperation justifying mitigation inasmuch as Customs has the right to examine an importer's books and records pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508-1509.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Immediate Remedial Action.</E> This factor includes the payment of the actual loss of duty prior to the issuance of a penalty notice and within 30 days after Customs notifies the alleged violator of the actual loss of duties attributable to the alleged violation. In appropriate cases, where the violator provides evidence that immediately after learning of the violation, substantial remedial action was taken to correct organizational or procedural defects, immediate remedial action may be granted as a mitigating factor. Customs encourages immediate remedial action to ensure against future incidents of non-compliance.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Inexperience in Importing.</E> Inexperience is a factor only if it contributes to the violation and the violation is not due to fraud or gross negligence.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Prior Good Record.</E> Prior good record is a factor only if the alleged violator is able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of importations without violation of section 592, or any other statute prohibiting false or fraudulent importation practices. This factor will not be considered in alleged fraudulent violations of section 592.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Inability to Pay the Customs Penalty.</E> The party claiming the existence of this factor must present documentary evidence in support thereof, including copies of income tax returns for the previous 3 years, and an audited financial statement for the most recent fiscal quarter. In certain cases, Customs may waive the production of an audited financial statement or may request alternative or additional financial data in order to facilitate an analysis of a claim of inability to pay (e.g., examination of the financial records of a foreign entity related to the U.S. company claiming inability to pay).</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Customs Knowledge.</E> Additional relief in non-fraud cases (which also are not the subject of a criminal investigation) will be granted if it is determined that Customs had actual knowledge of a violation and, without justification, failed to inform the violator so that it could have taken earlier corrective action. In such cases, if a penalty is to be assessed involving repeated violations of the same kind, the maximum penalty amount for violations occurring after the date on which actual knowledge was obtained by Customs will be limited to two times the loss of duty in duty-loss cases or twenty percent of the dutiable value in non-duty-loss cases if the continuing violations were the result of gross negligence, or the lesser of one time the loss of duty in duty-loss cases or ten percent of dutiable value in non-duty-loss cases if the violations were the result of negligence. This factor will not be applicable when a substantial delay in the investigation is attributable to the alleged violator.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(H) Aggravating Factors</HD>
            <P>Certain factors may be determined to be aggravating factors in calculating the amount of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or the amount of the administrative penalty decision. The presence of one or more aggravating factors may not be used to raise the level of culpability attributable to the alleged violations, but may be utilized to offset the presence of mitigating factors. The following factors will be considered “aggravating factors,” provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not exclusive.</P>
            <P>(1) Obstructing an investigation or audit,</P>
            <P>(2) Withholding evidence,</P>
            <P>(3) Providing misleading information concerning the violation,</P>
            <P>(4) Prior substantive violations of section 592 for which a final administrative finding of culpability has been made,</P>

            <P>(5) Textile imports that have been the subject of illegal transshipment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> false country of origin declaration), whether or not the merchandise bears false country of origin markings,</P>
            <P>(6) Evidence of a motive to evade a prohibition or restriction on the admissibility of the merchandise (e.g., evading a quota restriction),</P>

            <P>(7) Failure to comply with a lawful demand for records or a Customs summons.<PRTPAGE P="333"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(I) Offers in Compromise (“Settlement Offers”)</HD>
            <P>Parties who wish to submit a civil offer in compromise pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1617 (also known as a “settlement offer”) in connection with any section 592 claim or potential section 592 claim should follow the procedures outlined in § 161.5 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 161.5). Settlement offers do not involve “mitigation” of a claim or potential claim, but rather “compromise” an action or potential action where Customs evaluation of potential litigation risks, or the alleged violator's financial position, justifies such a disposition. In any case where a portion of the offered amount represents a tender of unpaid duties, taxes and fees, Customs letter of acceptance may identify the portion representing any such duty, tax and fee. The offered amount should be deposited at the Customs field office responsible for handling the section 592 claim or potential section 592 claim. The offered amount will be held in a suspense account pending acceptance or rejection of the offer in compromise. In the event the offer is rejected, the concerned Customs field office will promptly initiate a refund of the money deposited in the suspense account to the offeror.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(J) Section 592(d) Demands</HD>
            <P>Section 592(d) demands for actual losses of duty ordinarily are issued in connection with a penalty action, or as a separate demand without an associated penalty action. In either case, information must be present establishing a violation of section 592(a). In those cases where the appropriate Customs field officer determines that issuance of a penalty under section 592 is not warranted (notwithstanding the presence of information establishing a violation of section 592(a)), but that circumstances do warrant issuance of a demand for payment of an actual loss of duty pursuant to section 592(d), the Customs field officer shall follow the procedures set forth in section 162.79b of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.79b). Except in cases where less than one year remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense, information copies of all section 592(d) demands should be sent to all concerned sureties and the importer of record if such party is not an alleged violator. Also, except in cases where less than one year remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense, Customs will endeavor to issue all section 592(d) demands to concerned sureties and non-violator importers of record only after default by principals.</P>

            <P>If a customs broker commits a section 592 violation and the violation involves fraud, or the broker commits a grossly negligent or negligent violation and shares in the benefits of the violation to an extent over and above customary brokerage fees, the customs broker will be subject to these guidelines. However, if the customs broker commits either a grossly negligent or negligent violation of section 592 (without sharing in the benefits of the violation as described above), the concerned Customs field officer may proceed against the customs broker pursuant to the remedies provided under 19 U.S.C. 1641.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 171—Customs Regulations Guidelines for the Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1641</HD>
            <P>The Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 promulgated numerous changes to the current statute relating to Customs brokers. The following document attempts to define that conduct which is to be proscribed and to suggest penalty amounts to be assessed for such violations. It also chronicles procedures to be followed in assessment and mitigation of penalties.</P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Assessment of a monetary penalty is an alternative sanction to revocation or suspension of the broker's license or permit.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Penalty Assessment Procedures—19 CFR Part 111, Subpart E</HD>

            <P>A. When a penalty against a broker is contemplated, the “appropriate Customs officer”, (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer) shall issue a written notice which advises the violator of the allegations which would warrant imposition of a penalty. The written notice shall be in a format similar to a prepenalty notice that would be issued in contemplation of assessment of a penalty under section 1592 or 1584.</P>
            <P>B. The written notice shall inform the violator that he has 30 days to respond as to why a penalty should not be issued. See 19 CFR 111.92.</P>
            <P>C. If no response is received from the violator, or, if after receipt of the response, it is determined that the penalty should be issued as stated in the prepenalty notice, a notice of penalty CF-5955A shall be issued formally assessing a monetary penalty against the broker.</P>
            <P>D. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may reduce the amount of the contemplated penalty or cancel its issuance altogether if, after review of the violator's submission in response to the prepenalty notice, he is satisfied that the acts which are the basis for the penalty did not occur as charged or occurred in a manner that would permit a reduction in the contemplated penalty.</P>
            <P>E. After issuance of a penalty notice, the petitioning provisions of part 171 of the Customs Regulations are in effect.</P>
            <P>F. If the broker does not comply with a final mitigation decision within 60 days, the matter shall be referred to the Department of Justice for commencement of judicial action.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Penalty Assessment—Conducting Customs Business Without a License (19 U.S.C. 1641(<E T="01">b</E>)(6))</HD>
            <P>A. No person may conduct Customs business, other than solely on behalf of that person, without a broker's license.</P>
            <P>B. Penalty amount:</P>
            <P>1. The maximum penalty for any one incident of conducting Customs business without a license is $10,000.</P>
            <P>2. Total aggregate penalties for violation of this or any other section of the broker penalty statute is $30,000. As a general rule, $10,000 will be the maximum assessment for a violation solely involving conducting Customs business without a license, without regard to the frequency of violations. In particularly aggravated circumstances, this rule shall be suspended.</P>
            <P>C. Customs business includes:</P>
            <P>1. Classification and valuation.</P>
            <P>2. Payment of duties, taxes or other charges.</P>
            <P>3. Drawback or refund of duties.</P>
            <P>4. Filing of entries or other documents relating to issues covered by 1-3.</P>
            <P>D. Customs business does not include:</P>
            <P>1. Marine transactions.</P>
            <P>2. In-bond movement or transportation of merchandise.</P>
            <P>3. Foreign Trade Zone admissions. See C.S.D. 84-23.</P>
            <P>E. Penalty amounts to be imposed for transacting Customs business without a license are as follows:</P>

            <P>1. No penalty action when importation is conducted on behalf of a family member. For <PRTPAGE P="335"/>purposes of this subsection, “family member” is defined as a parent, child, spouse, sibling, grandparent or grandchild.</P>
            <P>2. No penalty action against an individual who has a power of attorney to act as an unpaid agent on a non-commercial shipment. See 19 CFR 141.33.</P>
            <P>3. A $250 penalty for:</P>
            <P>a. First violation when transaction is non-commercial but is conducted on behalf of any business entity, or</P>

            <P>b. First violation where the importation is commercial in nature (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, imported merchandise is for resale) <E T="03">or</E> where the violator is compensated for his action, e.g., an importation of raw material or parts of merchandise that is to be manufactured, refined or assembled here before resale would be a commercial entry because the merchandise eventually would be resold, albeit in another form than that which it was entered.</P>
            <P>4. A $1,000 penalty for repeat violation involving:</P>
            <P>a. Commercial importation.</P>
            <P>b. Non-commercial importation made on behalf of a business entity.</P>
            <P>c. Non-commercial importation for which compensation is received by the violator.</P>
            <P>5. A $10,000 penalty when:</P>
            <P>a. Violator falsely holds himself out as being a licensed Customs broker.</P>
            <P>b. A continuing course of conduct can be shown (determined by frequency of violations or number of entries involved) which would indicate that the violator is entering merchandise for others on a regular commercial basis, e.g., if the violator has incurred numerous penalties under subsections (3) and (4) above, but the smaller penalties have had no deterrent effect, the $10,000 penalty under this subsection should be assessed in an action separate from those smaller penalties.</P>
            <P>F. Mitigation—No mitigation will be afforded for any violation involving conducting Customs business without a license unless the violator can show an inability to pay such penalty.</P>
            <P>G. IMPORTANT: As a general rule, a separate penalty should not be imposed for each unlawful Customs business transaction if numerous transactions occur contemporaneously. For example:</P>
            <P>1. If an unlicensed individual files six commercial entries at one time, that should be treated as one violation. It should not be treated as six violations because the entries were presented contemporaneously.</P>
            <P>2. If Customs discovers that an individual has conducted Customs business without a license on numerous occasions, but such individual acted without knowledge of the prohibition on such conduct, those numerous transactions should be treated as one violation for purposes of imposition of any penalty.</P>
            <P>H. <E T="04">Note:</E> Conducting Customs business without a license is not the same violation as conducting Customs business without a permit. The latter violation is discussed later in this appendix in the section involving Violation of Other Laws or Regulations Enforced by Customs.</P>
            <P>I. Intent to violate the law is not an element of this violation. Reference to “intentionally transacts Customs business” in subsection 1641(b)(6) relates to the intentional transaction of the business itself, not to any intentional attempt to violate the terms of the statute.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Section 1641(<E T="01">d</E>)(1)(A)—Making a False or Misleading Statement or an Omission as to Material Fact Which Was Required To Be Stated in Any Application for a License or Permit</HD>
            <P>A. If the license would not have been issued but for the false statement, the proper sanction would be suspension or revocation of the license. If the false or misleading statement would not have absolutely resulted in the denial, revocation or suspension of a license, then penalty sanctions are proper.</P>
            <P>B. Material facts include but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>1. Facts as to identity.</P>
            <P>2. Facts as to citizenship status of an individual.</P>
            <P>3. Facts as to moral character of an individual which relate to his fitness to conduct Customs business.</P>
            <P>4. The organization of any corporation, association or partnership.</P>
            <P>5. The status of the license of a license holder who is a corporate officer or partner.</P>
            <P>C. Penalty Amount—$5,000 for each false statement, to a maximum of $30,000.</P>
            <P>D. Examples of situations where revocation of the license is appropriate.</P>
            <P>1. An applicant states that he is 21 years old (as required by 19 CFR 111.11) and he is not. But for the false statement, the applicant could not meet the age requirement for a license.</P>
            <P>2. An applicant provides an alias in the application which is a material false statement as to identity.</P>
            <P>E. Mitigation guidelines.</P>
            <P>1. Violation due to clerical error (clerical error as defined by 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1)), mitigated without payment.</P>
            <P>2. Violation due to negligence.</P>
            <P>a. This is defined as more than clerical error, but not an intentional violation. Examples include:</P>
            <P>i. Failing to list a new corporate office because corporate records have not been kept current.</P>
            <P>ii. Listing an incorrect address for a reference because applicant has failed to update his records.</P>

            <P>b. Mitigate to $500 for each $5,000 penalty assessed.<PRTPAGE P="336"/>
            </P>
            <P>c. This category excludes cases of harmless error, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, a mistake which could not possibly harm the government's interests. Cases falling in this category should be mitigated in full.</P>
            <P>3. Intentional violations—Revocation of a license which has been granted is the preferred sanction. If no license has been granted, no mitigation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Section 1641(<E T="01">d</E>)(1)(B)—Broker Convicted of Certain Felonies or Misdemeanors Subsequent To Filing License Application</HD>
            <P>A. As a general rule, license revocation is the standard sanction for these violations. If the conviction occurs subsequent to the filing of an application, monetary penalties may be assessed according to the following criteria.</P>
            <P>B. Unlawful conduct must relate to:</P>
            <P>1. Importation or exportation of merchandise.</P>
            <P>2. Conduct of Customs business (this shall include violations relating to taxes and duties and documents required to be filed with regard to such taxes and duties).</P>
            <P>3. Relevant convictions would include:</P>
            <P>a. 18 U.S.C. 1001—making a false statement to Customs or any other agency with regard to any relevant transaction.</P>
            <P>b. 18 U.S.C. 545—unlawful importation of merchandise.</P>
            <P>c. 18 U.S.C. 542—unlawful importation by means of a fraudulent act or omission.</P>
            <P>d. 22 U.S.C. 2778—illegal exportation of munitions.</P>
            <P>C. Monetary penalties may not be imposed in connection with convictions relating to conduct described in subsection 1641(d)(1)(B)(iii) including larceny, theft, robbery, extortion, counterfeiting, fraudulent concealment or conversion, embezzlement or misappropriation of funds. Either suspension or revocation is the appropriate penalty for these infractions.</P>
            <P>D. Penalty amounts.</P>
            <P>1. $15,000 for a misdemeanor conviction.</P>
            <P>2. $30,000 for a felony conviction.</P>
            <P>E. Mitigation.</P>
            <P>1. For a misdemeanor conviction, mitigation to a lesser amount is permitted if the conviction related to Customs business and the domestic value of the merchandise involved is less than $15,000. In such case, mitigation to an amount equal to the domestic value of the merchandise is appropriate.</P>
            <P>2. For other misdemeanor convictions, no relief.</P>
            <P>3. Felony convictions, no relief.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Section 1641(<E T="01">d</E>)(1)(C)—Violation of Any Law Enforced by the Customs Service or the Rules or Regulations Issued Under Any Such Provision</HD>

            <P>A. Penalties under this section may be imposed in addition to any penalty provided for under the law enforced by Customs. <E T="03">Exception:</E> Penalties imposed against a broker under 19 U.S.C. 1592 at a culpability level of less than fraud or under 19 U.S.C. 1595a(b) shall not be imposed in addition to a broker's penalty.</P>
            <P>B. Additional penalties under this section shall also be imposed against any broker where the other statute violated only moves against property, or the violator has demonstrated a continuing course of illegal conduct or evidence exists which indicates repeated violations of other statutes or regulations.</P>
            <P>C. Conducting Customs business without a permit penalties should be assessed under this section.</P>
            <P>1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 111.19 as the regulation violated. A party operating without a permit is required to apply for one under the above-noted regulation.</P>
            <P>2. Assessment amount—$1,000 per transaction conducted without a permit.</P>
            <P>3. Mitigation.</P>
            <P>a. Negligence, mitigate to $250-$500 per transaction depending on the presence of mitigating factors (lack of knowledge of permit requirement).</P>
            <P>b. Intentional, grant no relief.</P>
            <P>c. No mitigation if permit revoked by operation of law.</P>
            <P>4. Generally, a separate penalty should not be assessed for each non-permitted transaction if numerous transactions occurred contemporaneously. For example, if a broker files 30 entries the day after a permit expires, the 30 filings should be treated as one violation, not 30 separate violations.</P>
            <P>D. Penalties for failure to exercise due diligence in payment, refund or deposit of monies received from clients in connection with clients' Customs business also should be assessed under this section. This includes failure to pay over to a client, or file a written statement to a client accounting for, funds received.</P>
            <P>1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 111.29 as the regulation violated.</P>
            <P>2. Assessment amount—an amount equal to the value of any monies up to a maximum of $30,000, to be deposited with Customs or refunded or accounted for to a client.</P>
            <P>3. No mitigation shall be afforded until the monies are properly paid to Customs or refunded or accounted for to the clients.</P>

            <P>4. If any claims for liquidated damages result against the client's bond from the failure to pay monies to Customs, no mitigation from the penalty shall be granted until the <PRTPAGE P="337"/>claim for liquidated damages is settled <E T="03">by the violating broker</E> either through payment of the full claim or a mitigated amount.</P>
            <P>5. After monies are paid or accounted for and/or liquidated damages claims are settled as stated in 3. and 4. above, mitigation may be afforded. If the violator is found to be negligent, the penalty may be mitigated to an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the assessed amount, but no lower than $250. No mitigation from an intentional violation.</P>
            <P>E. Penalties for failure to retain powers of attorney from clients to act in their names.</P>
            <P>1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 141.46 as the regulation violated.</P>
            <P>2. Assessment amount—$1,000 for each power of attorney not on file.</P>
            <P>3. Mitigation—for a first offense, mitigate to an amount between $250 and $500 unless extraordinary mitigating factors are present, in which case full mitigation should be afforded. An extraordinary mitigating factor would be a fire, theft or other destruction of records beyond broker control. Subsequent offenses—no mitigation unless extraordinary mitigating factors are present.</P>
            <P>4. Penalty should be mitigated in full if it can be established that a valid power of attorney had been issued to the broker, but it was misplaced or destroyed through clerical error or mistake.</P>

            <P>F. If the other statute violated moves only against property, the violator shall incur a monetary penalty equal to the domestic value of such property or $30,000, whichever is less.
            </P>
            <FP>e.g., Violation of 22 U.S.C. 401 for unlawful exportation of merchandise results in seizure and forfeiture of the violative merchandise. There are no penalty provisions which Customs enforces against parties responsible for the seizable offense. If brokers are recalcitrant and are constantly responsible for offenses which result in seizure of merchandise, a penalty equal to the domestic value of such merchandise (in no case to exceed $30,000) should be imposed.</FP>
            <P>G. Use of a broker's importation bond to aid an importer who has had his immediate delivery privileges revoked.</P>
            <P>1. The broker has aided his client in avoiding the immediate delivery sanctions. The penalty notice should cite 19 CFR 142.25(c) as the regulation violated. Before assessment of this penalty, the broker should be shown to have known or been negligent in not knowing of the client's sanction.</P>
            <P>2. A penalty equal to the value of the merchandise, not to exceed $30,000, should be assessed.</P>
            <P>3. Mitigation—The penalty shall be mitigated to an amount between 25 and 50 percent of that assessed for a first violation where negligence is shown. Any knowing violation or a subsequent negligent violation (not necessarily involving the same client) will result in no mitigation.</P>
            <P>H. If the other statute violated provides for a personal penalty, the violator shall incur an additional monetary penalty under this section equal to such personal penalty or $30,000, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>I. Penalties assessed under this provision are not limited to violations just involving Customs business as defined in the statute.</P>
            <P>J. Mitigation guidelines.</P>
            <P>1. If the other law violated moves only against property, mitigate the penalty using guidelines in effect for the other statute violated. For example, if the broker is responsible for a 401 seizure of merchandise valued at $45,000, he incurs a penalty of $30,000. The guidelines for remission of the 401 forfeiture are applicable to mitigation of the broker penalty. Thus, if the forfeiture is remitted upon payment of 5 percent of the merchandise's value, the penalty will be mitigated upon payment of a like amount.</P>

            <P>2. If the other law violated provides for a personal penalty, mitigate the broker penalty using guidelines in effect for the other statute violated.
            </P>
            <FP>For example, a broker incurs a $40,000 penalty under 1592. The penalty amount represents eight times the loss of revenue because a preliminary finding of fraud is made (see section V.A. of this appendix). A penalty of $30,000, in addition to the $40,000 penalty issued under 1592, may be assessed. The 1592 penalty is later mitigated to $25,000, an amount equal to five times the loss of revenue, as the finding of fraud is upheld and it is also determined that the broker shared in the financial benefits of the violation. The broker penalty also should be mitigated to that $25,000 figure, for a total collection of $50,000.</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Section 1641(<E T="01">d</E>)(1)(D)—Counseling, Commanding, Inducing, Procuring or Knowingly Aiding and Abetting Violations by Any Other Person of Any Law Enforced by the Customs Service</HD>
            <P>A. If the law violated by another moves only against property, a monetary penalty equal to the domestic value of such property or $30,000 whichever is less, may be imposed against the broker who counsels, commands or knowingly aids and abets such violation.</P>
            <P>B. If the law violated provides for only a personal penalty against the actual violator, a penalty may be imposed against the broker in an amount equal to that assessed against the violator, but in no case can the penalty exceed $30,000.</P>
            <P>C. If the broker is assessed a penalty under the statute violated by the other person, he may be assessed a penalty under this section in addition to any other penalties.</P>
            <P>D. Examples of violations of this subsection:</P>

            <P>1. A broker counsels a client that certain gemstones are absolutely free of duty and <PRTPAGE P="338"/>need not be declared upon entry into the United States. The client arrives in the United States and fails to declare a quantity of gemstones worth $45,000. A penalty of $30,000 may be imposed against the broker for such counseling. The client would incur a personal penalty of $45,000 under the provisions of title 19, United States Code, section 1497, but the penalty against the broker cannot exceed $30,000.</P>
            <P>2. A client imports $15,000 worth of merchandise by vessel. The merchandise is unladen at the wharf but Customs has not appraised or released it. Customs informs the broker that the shipment must be held for an intensive examination. The broker informs the client that the merchandise can be moved and delivered to the consignee. The broker assures his client that he will handle all the necessary paperwork. The merchandise is moved from the wharf. The broker is subject to a $15,000 penalty for counseling and inducing his client to violate the provisions of title 19, United States Code, section 1448 and title 19, United States Code, section 1595a(b).</P>
            <P>E. Mitigation—Follow guidelines applicable to the other penalty or forfeiture statute involved.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Section 1641(<E T="01">d</E>)(1)(E)—Knowingly Employing or Continuing To Employ Any Person Who Has Been Convicted of a Felony, Without Written Approval of Such Employment From the Secretary of the Treasury</HD>
            <P>A. A broker has 30 days to seek approval of the Secretary for such employment. If he seeks the approval within such time, no penalty will be assessed.</P>
            <P>B. A $5,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon and failing to make application with the Secretary approving such employment within 30 days of the date of discovery of the felony conviction.</P>
            <P>C. A $25,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon without seeking approval for employment.</P>
            <P>D. A $30,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon and continuing to employ same after approval has been denied (generally revocation or suspension of the license would be appropriate under this circumstance).</P>
            <P>E. <E T="03">Example:</E> If a broker unknowingly employs a convicted felon and 1 year after employment discovers the existence of such a conviction, the following actions would dictate imposition of a penalty:</P>
            <P>1. If he seeks approval of the Secretary within 30 days after discovery of the existence of the conviction, no penalty will be assessed.</P>
            <P>2. If he seeks approval at some time after 30 days from the date of discovery, a $5,000 penalty would lie.</P>
            <P>3. If he does not seek approval until after Customs becomes aware of the violation, a $25,000 penalty would lie.</P>
            <P>4. If he seeks approval, but is denied, and continues to employ the convicted felon, a $30,000 penalty would lie.</P>
            <P>F. Customs discovery of a felony conviction. If Customs discovers the felony conviction and there is no indication that the employer is aware of same, Customs may inform the employer of such conviction. Discretion should be used in divulging this information.</P>
            <P>G. Mitigation will only be permitted from the $5,000 penalty as follows:</P>
            <P>1. If the application for approval is submitted within 60 days, but after 30 days, mitigate to $2,000.</P>
            <P>2. If there is no application beyond the 60-day period, no mitigation shall be granted. Continued employment will result in further penalties as described above in sections E.3 and E.4.</P>

            </NOTE>
            
            <P>B. The following penalty amounts shall be assessed against brokers who fail to exercise responsible supervision and control over business conducted at district level.</P>
            <P>1. A penalty of $1,000 against any broker who:</P>
            <P>a. Continuously makes the same errors on a particular type of entry;</P>
            <P>b. Fails to properly instruct employees about Customs business, thereby resulting in the filing of incorrect entries or the mishandling of transactions relating to Customs business;</P>
            <P>c. Knowingly allows his entry bond to be used to effect release of merchandise in districts where he does not have a license or permit (this is imposed in addition to any penalty for conducting Customs business without a license);</P>
            <P>d. Fails to comply with regulations or procedures but does not commit violations that would warrant any higher penalty amount as described below.</P>
            <P>2. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who, when requested, is unable to produce documents relating to specific Customs business which are material to that business (e.g., if the business regards an entry he should have the invoice, packing list, etc.). This requirement excludes documents not required to be kept by a broker.</P>
            <P>3. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who is unable to satisfy the deciding Customs official that he has a working knowledge of any operation material to his ability to render valuable service to others in the conduct of Customs business.</P>
            <P>Examples include:</P>
            <P>a. A working knowledge of all automated systems in use in the district;</P>
            <P>b. A knowledge of the cash flow procedures in each district of operation;</P>
            <P>c. Retention of copies of all surety bonds in proper form and in sufficient dollar amount;</P>
            <P>d. Knowledge of filing systems and document record storage in each district;</P>
            <P>e. Continuous monitoring to ensure timely payment of all obligations including duties, taxes and refunds.</P>
            <P>4. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who fails to exercise responsible supervision and control over the Customs business that it conducts as defined in section XI.C. of this appendix.</P>
            <P>5. A penalty of $10,000 against any broker who is found to have failed to maintain satisfactory accounting records or records of documents filed with Customs on any matter.</P>
            <P>C. The following factors shall be indicative of a lack of supervision or lack of working knowledge of Customs procedures (the list is not conclusive):</P>
            <P>1. A high rate of entry rejections when compared with other brokers in the permitted district.</P>
            <P>2. A high rate of late filing liquidated damages cases when compared with other brokers in the permitted district.</P>
            <P>3. In the case of entry summaries filed in the broker's name, a high number of missing document cases when compared with other brokers in the permitted district.</P>
            <P>4. An inordinate number of entries for which free entry is claimed, but no documentation supporting such claim is submitted, resulting in liquidation of the entries as dutiable.</P>
            <P>5. Inability to assist or failure to cooperate with an audit, including failure to provide all records and any other necessary information pertaining to a broker's Customs business to assist auditors.</P>
            <P>6. Failure to settle (including petitioning) liquidated damages claims in a timely manner.</P>
            <P>7. Evidence to indicate that timely duty refunds to clients are not made or accounted for and adequate records of same are not kept (usually will result in penalty assessed in accordance with section B.5. above).</P>
            <P>8. Employing a licensed individual for a minimal number of days each 120- or 180-day period (see sections 1641(b)(5) and 1641(c)(3) so as to avoid violation of the statute.</P>

            <P>a. For purposes of imposition of penalties under this subsection, a minimal number of days shall be 10 working days for each 120-<PRTPAGE P="340"/>day period or 15 working days for each 180-day period.</P>

            <P>b. It shall be presumed that temporary employment of such a licensed individual is undertaken solely to avoid revocation of a license or permit. Such minimal employment shall be <E T="03">prima facie</E> evidence of lack of supervision.</P>
            <P>D. Mitigation.</P>
            <P>1. $1,000 penalties shall not be mitigated unless the broker can show that extraordinary mitigating factors are present.</P>
            <P>2. $5,000 penalties for failure to produce documents may be mitigated to an amount between $2,000 and $3,500 if the documents are produced but not in a timely fashion. No mitigation shall be afforded if the documents are not produced, unless the broker can satisfactorily demonstrate that such failure to produce was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the broker or his client (e.g., a rupture of relations with the party responsible for generating the documents). Full mitigation shall be afforded in the case of destruction of records by events beyond a broker's control, such as theft, flood, fire or other acts of God.</P>
            <P>3. $5,000 penalty for failure to have a working knowledge of any operation for which a broker is licensed to do business may be mitigated to a lesser amount upon a showing by the broker that steps have been taken to improve instruction and supervision of employees and an improvement in the knowledge of his operation occurs.</P>
            <P>4. $5,000 penalty for failure to exercise responsible supervision and control may be mitigated to a lesser amount if the broker immediately corrects the problem which was the basis for the assessment and sufficiently monitors the situation to avoid recurrence.</P>

            <P>5. $10,000 penalty for failure to maintain satisfactory accounting records will only be subject to mitigation in full if the broker can prove that satisfactory accounting records and documents records are being kept. Mitigation in a lesser degree may be afforded upon a showing by the broker that a <E T="03">bona fide</E> attempt was made to establish a satisfactory accounting and/or recordkeeping system, or upgrade a deficient system, but such efforts proved unsuccessful or only partially effective.</P>
            <P>6. Penalty equal to the value of monies not properly paid or accounted for.</P>
            <P>a. If the broker shows that the monies were paid or accounted for and requisite notifications were made, albeit in an untimely fashion not to exceed 30 days after any due date, the penalty may be mitigated upon payment of 25 percent of the assessed amount, but no less than $250.</P>
            <P>b. If the monies were paid and notifications made more than 30 days after any due date, the penalty may be mitigated upon payment of 50 percent of the assessed amount, but not less than $1,000.</P>
            <P>c. If there is no proof of proper payment of duties, refunds, etc., no mitigation shall be granted.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">XII. Limits of Penalty Assessments</HD>
            <P>A. A broker shall be penalized a maximum of $30,000 for any violation or violations of the statute in any one penalty notice.</P>
            <P>B. If a broker is penalized to the maximum the statute will allow and continues to commit the same violation or violations, revocation or suspension of his license would be the appropriate sanction. Barring such revocation or suspension action, he may again be penalized to the maximum the statute will allow.</P>
            <P>C. From any one audit, the maximum aggregate penalty for all violations discovered is $30,000.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">XIII. Consolidation of Cases</HD>
            <P>Whenever multiple penalties arising from a particular fact situation or pattern are contemplated against brokers or individuals operating in different districts, the cases may be consolidated in one district.

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Part 171—Guidelines for the Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1593a</HD>

            <P>A monetary penalty incurred under section 593A, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1593a; hereinafter referred to as section 593A), may be remitted or mitigated under section 618, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618; hereinafter referred to as section 618), if it is determined that there exist such mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation. The guidelines below will be used by Customs in arriving at a just and reasonable assessment and disposition of liabilities arising under section 593A within the stated limitations. It is intended that these guidelines will be applied by Customs officers in prepenalty proceedings, in determining the monetary penalty assessed in the penalty notice, and in arriving at a final penalty disposition. The assessed or mitigated penalty amount set forth in Customs administrative disposition determined in accordance with these guidelines does not limit the penalty amount which the Government may seek in bringing a civil enforcement action pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1593a(i).<PRTPAGE P="341"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(A) Violations of Section 593A</HD>
            <P>A violation of section 593A occurs when a person, through fraud or negligence, seeks, induces, or affects, or attempts to seek, induce, or affect, the payment or credit to that person or others of any drawback claim by means of any document, written or oral statement, or electronically transmitted data or information, or act which is material and false, or any omission which is material, or aids or abets any other person in the foregoing violation. There is no violation if the falsity is due solely to clerical error or mistake of fact unless the error or mistake is part of a pattern of negligent conduct. Also, the mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error will not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct. Nevertheless, if Customs has drawn the person's attention to the nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error, subsequent failure to correct the error could constitute a violation of section 593A.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(B) Degrees of Culpability</HD>
            <P>There are two degrees of culpability under section 593A: negligence and fraud.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Negligence.</E> A violation is determined to be negligent if it results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done with actual knowledge of, or wanton disregard for, the relevant facts and with indifference to, or disregard for, the offender's obligations under the statute or done through the failure to exercise the degree of reasonable care and competence expected from a person in the same circumstances in ascertaining the facts or in drawing inferences from those facts, in ascertaining the offender's obligations under the statute, or in communicating information so that it may be understood by the recipient. As a general rule, a violation is determined to be negligent if it results from the offender's failure to exercise reasonable care and competence to ensure that a statement made is correct.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Fraud.</E> A violation is determined to be fraudulent if the material false statement, omission or act in connection with the transaction was committed (or omitted) knowingly, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, was done voluntarily and intentionally, as established by clear and convincing evidence.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(C) Assessment of Penalties</HD>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Issuance of Prepenalty Notice.</E> As provided in § 162.77a of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.77a), if Customs has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 593A has occurred and determines that further proceedings are warranted, a notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty will be issued to the person concerned. In issuing such prepenalty notice, the appropriate Customs field officer will make a tentative determination of the degree of culpability and the amount of the proposed claim. A prepenalty notice will not be issued if the claim does not exceed $1,000.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Issuance of Penalty Notice.</E> After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (C)(1), the appropriate Customs field officer will determine whether any violation described in section (A) has occurred. If a notice was issued under paragraph (C)(1) and the appropriate Customs field officer determines that there was no violation, Customs will promptly issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the appropriate Customs field officer determines that there was a violation, Customs will issue a written penalty claim to the person concerned. The written penalty claim will specify all changes in the information provided in the prepenalty notice issued under paragraph (C)(1). The person to whom the penalty notice is issued will have a reasonable opportunity under section 618 to make representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any proceeding under section 618, Customs will provide to the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final determination and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(D) Maximum Penalties</HD>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Fraud.</E> In the case of a fraudulent violation of section 593A, the monetary penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Negligence.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In General.</E> In the case of a negligent violation of section 593A, the monetary penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue for the first violation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Repetitive Violations.</E> For the first negligent violation that is repetitive (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, involves the same issue and the same violator), the penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue. The penalty for a second and each subsequent repetitive negligent violation will be in an amount not to exceed the actual or potential loss of revenue.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Prior Disclosure.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In General.</E> Subject to paragraph (D)(3)(b), if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of section 593A before, or without knowledge of the commencement of, a formal investigation of such violation, the monetary penalty assessed under this Appendix will not exceed:</P>

            <P>(i) In the case of fraud, an amount equal to the actual or potential revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived as a result of overpayment of the claim; or<PRTPAGE P="342"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) If the violation resulted from negligence, an amount equal to the interest computed on the basis of the prevailing rate of interest applied under 26 U.S.C. 6621 on the amount of actual revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived during the period that begins on the date of overpayment of the claim and ends on the date on which the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Condition Affecting Penalty Limitations.</E> The limitations in paragraph (D)(3)(a) on the amount of the monetary penalty to be assessed apply only if the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment made on the claim either at the time of the disclosure or within 30 days (or such longer period as Customs may provide) from the date of notice by Customs of its calculation of the amount of overpayment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Burden of Proof.</E> The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Commencement of Investigation.</E> For purposes of this Appendix, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party, and with regard to the disclosed information, on the date recorded in writing by Customs as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered which caused Customs to believe that a possibility of a violation of section 593A existed.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Exclusivity.</E> Penalty claims under section D will be the exclusive civil remedy for any drawback-related violation of section 593A.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(E) Deprivation of Lawful Revenue</HD>
            <P>Notwithstanding section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties and taxes resulting from a violation of section 593A, Customs will require that such duties and taxes be restored whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(F) Final Disposition of Penalty Cases When the Drawback Claimant Is Not a Certified Participant in the Drawback Compliance Program</HD>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">In General.</E> Customs will consider all information in the petition and all available evidence, taking into account any mitigating, aggravating, and extraordinary factors, in determining the final assessed penalty. All factors considered should be stated in the decision.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Penalty Disposition When There Has Been No Prior Disclosure.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Nonrepetitive Negligent Violation.</E> The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 10 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">First Repetitive Negligent Violation.</E> The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 25 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of 50 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fraudulent Violation.</E> The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 1.5 times the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of 3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Penalty Disposition When There Has Been a Prior Disclosure.</E>
            </P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fraudulent Violation.</E> The final penalty disposition will be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Mitigating Factors.</E> The following factors will be considered in mitigation of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or final penalty amount, provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not exclusive.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Contributory Customs Error.</E> This factor includes misleading or erroneous advice given by a Customs official in writing to the alleged violator, but this factor may be applied in such a case only if it appears that the alleged violator reasonably relied upon the written information and the alleged violator fully and accurately informed Customs of all relevant facts. The concept of comparative negligence may be utilized in determining the weight to be assigned to this factor. If the Customs error contributed to the violation, but the alleged violator is also culpable, the Customs error is to be considered as a mitigating factor. If it is determined that the Customs error was the sole cause of the violation, the proposed or assessed penalty is to be cancelled.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Cooperation With the Investigation.</E> To obtain the benefits of this factor, the alleged violator must exhibit cooperation beyond that expected from a person under investigation for a Customs violation. An example of the cooperation contemplated includes assisting Customs officers to an unusual degree in auditing the books and records of the alleged violator (e.g., incurring extraordinary expenses in providing computer runs solely for submission to Customs to assist the agency in cases involving an unusually large number of entries and/or complex issues). <PRTPAGE P="343"/>Another example consists of assisting Customs in obtaining additional information relating to the subject violation or other violations. Merely providing the books and records of the alleged violator may not be considered cooperation justifying mitigation inasmuch as Customs has the right to examine an importer's books and records pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508-1509.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Immediate Remedial Action.</E> This factor includes the payment of the actual loss of revenue prior to the issuance of a penalty notice and within 30 days after Customs notifies the alleged violator of the actual loss of revenue attributable to the violation. In appropriate cases, where the alleged violator provides evidence that, immediately after learning of the violation, substantial remedial action was taken to correct organizational or procedural defects, immediate remedial action may be granted as a mitigating factor. Customs encourages immediate remedial action to ensure against future incidents of non-compliance.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Prior Good Record.</E> Prior good record is a factor only if the alleged violator is able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of filing drawback claims without violation of section 593A, or any other statute prohibiting the making or filing of a false statement or document in connection with a drawback claim. This factor will not be considered in alleged fraudulent violations of section 593A.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Inability to Pay the Customs Penalty.</E> The party claiming the existence of this factor must present documentary evidence in support thereof, including copies of income tax returns for the previous 3 years and an audited financial statement for the most recent fiscal quarter. In certain cases, Customs may waive the production of an audited financial statement or may request alternative or additional financial data in order to facilitate an analysis of a claim of inability to pay (e.g., examination of the financial records of a foreign entity related to the U.S. company claiming inability to pay). In addition, the alleged violator must present information reflecting ownership and related domestic and foreign parties and must provide information reflecting its current financial condition, including books and records of account, bank statements, other tax records (for example, sales tax returns) and a list of assets with current values; if the alleged violator is a closely held corporation, similar current financial information must be provided on the shareholders, wherever they are located.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Customs Knowledge.</E> This factor may be used in non-fraud cases (which also are not the subject of a criminal investigation) if it is determined that Customs had actual knowledge of a violation and failed, without justification, to inform the violator so that it could have taken earlier remedial action. This factor is not applicable when a substantial delay in the investigation is attributable to the alleged violator.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Aggravating Factors.</E> Certain factors may be determined to be aggravating factors in calculating the amount of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or the amount of the final administrative penalty. The presence of one or more aggravating factors may not be used to raise the level of culpability attributable to the alleged violations, but may be used to offset the presence of mitigating factors. The following factors will be considered “aggravating factors”, provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not exclusive.</P>
            <P>(a) Obstructing an investigation or audit.</P>
            <P>(b) Withholding evidence.</P>
            <P>(c) Providing misleading information concerning the violation.</P>
            <P>(d) Prior substantive violations of section 593A for which a final administrative finding of culpability has been made.</P>
            <P>(e) Failure to comply with a Customs summons or lawful demand for records.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">(G) Drawback Compliance Program Participants</HD>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">In General.</E> Special alternative procedures and penalty assessment standards apply in the case of negligent violations of section 593A committed by persons who are certified as participants in the Customs drawback compliance program and who are generally in compliance with the procedures and requirements of that program. Provisions regarding the operation of the drawback compliance program are set forth in part 191 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 191).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Alternatives to Penalties.</E> When a participant described in paragraph (G)(1) commits a violation of section 593A, in the absence of fraud or repeated violations and in lieu of a monetary penalty, Customs will issue a written notice of the violation (warning letter).</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents of Notice.</E> The notice will:</P>
            <P>(i) State that the person has violated section 593A;</P>
            <P>(ii) Explain the nature of the violation; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Warn the person that future violations of section 593A may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and that repetitive violations may result in removal of certification under the drawback compliance program until the person takes corrective action that is satisfactory to Customs.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Response to Notice.</E> Within 30 days from the date of mailing of the written notice, the person must notify Customs in writing of the steps that have been taken to prevent a recurrence of the violation unless the person establishes to the satisfaction of Customs that no violation took place (see § 162.73a(b)(2)(ii) of the Customs Regulations, 19 CFR 162.73a(b)(2)(ii)). If the person fails to provide the required notification in a timely manner, any penalty assessed for a repetitive <PRTPAGE P="344"/>violation under paragraph (G)(3) will not be subject to mitigation under this Appendix.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Repetitive Violations.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In General.</E> A person who has been issued a written notice under paragraph (G)(2) and who subsequently commits a negligent violation that is repetitive (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, involves the same issue), and any other person who is a participant described in paragraph (G)(1) and who commits a repetitive negligent violation, is subject to one of the following monetary penalties:</P>
            <P>(i) An amount not to exceed 20 percent of the loss of revenue for the first repetitive violation that occurs within three years from the date of the violation of which it is repetitive;</P>
            <P>(ii) An amount not to exceed 50 percent of the loss of revenue for the second repetitive violation that occurs within three years from the date of the first of two violations of which it is repetitive ; and</P>
            <P>(iii) An amount not to exceed 100 percent of the loss of revenue for the third and each subsequent repetitive violation that occurs within three years from the date of the first of three or more violations of which it is repetitive.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Repetitive Violations Outside 3-Year Period.</E> If a participant described in paragraph (G)(1) commits a negligent violation that is repetitive but that did not occur within 3 years of the violation of which it is repetitive, the new violation will be treated as a first violation for which a written notice will be issued in accordance with paragraph (G)(2), and each repetitive violation subsequent to that violation that occurs within any 3-year period described in paragraph (G)(3)(a) will result in the assessment of the applicable monetary penalty prescribed in that paragraph.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Final Penalty Disposition When There Has Been No Prior Disclosure.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In General.</E> Customs will consider all information in the petition and all available evidence, taking into account any mitigating factors (see paragraph (F)(4)), aggravating factors (see paragraph (F)(5)), and extraordinary factors in determining the final assessed penalty. All factors considered should be stated in the decision.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">First Repetitive Negligent Violation Within 3 Years of Violation Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2).</E> The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 10 percent of the loss of revenue to a maximum of 20 percent of the loss of revenue.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Second Repetitive Negligent Violation Within 3 Years of Violation Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2) or (G)(3).</E> The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 25 percent of the loss of revenue to a maximum of 50 percent of the loss of revenue.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Third and Each Subsequent Repetitive Negligent Violation Within 3 Years of Violation Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2) or (G)(3).</E> The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 50 percent of the loss of revenue to a maximum of 100 percent of the loss of revenue.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Fraudulent Violations.</E> The final penalty disposition will be determined in the same manner as in the case of fraudulent violations committed by persons who are not participants in the drawback compliance program (see paragraph (F)(2)(c)).</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Final Penalty Disposition When There Has Been A Prior Disclosure.</E> The final penalty disposition will be determined in the same manner as in the case of persons who are not participants in the drawback compliance program (see paragraph (F)(3)).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Mitigation decision not subject to protest.</E> Any decision to remit or mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon payment of a lesser amount is not a protestable decision as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514. Any payment made in compliance with any decision to remit or mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon payment of a lesser amount is not a charge or exaction and therefore is not a protestable action as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment of mitigated or cancellation amount as accord and satisfaction.</E> Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount in compliance with an administrative decision on a petition or supplemental petition for relief will be considered an election of administrative proceedings and full disposition of the case. Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount will act as an accord and satisfaction of the Government claim. Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount will never serve as a bar to filing a supplemental petition for relief.</P>

          <P>This part relates to the issuance of rulings to importers and other interested persons by the CBP, other than advance rulings under Article 509 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (see subpart I of part 181 of this chapter). It describes the situations in which a ruling may be requested, the procedures to be followed in requesting a ruling, the conditions under which a ruling will be issued, the effect of a ruling when it is issued, and the publication of rulings in the Customs Bulletin. The rulings issued under the provisions of this part will usually be prospective in application and, consequently, will usually not relate to specific matters or situations presently or previously under consideration by any CBP field office. Accordingly, the rulings requested under the provisions of this part should be distinguished from the administrative rulings, determinations, or decisions which may be requested under procedures set forth elsewhere in this chapter, including, but not limited to, those set forth in part 12 (relating to submissions of proof of admissibility of articles detained under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307)), part 103 (relating to disclosure of information in Customs files), part 133 (relating to disputed claims of piratical copying of copyrighted matter), subpart C of part 152 (relating to determinations concerning the dutiable value of merchandise by Customs field officers), part 153 (relating to enforcement of the Antidumping Act, 1921, as amended), part 159 (insofar as it relates to countervailing duties), part 171 (relating to fines, penalties, and forfeitures), part 172 (relating to liquidated damages), part 174 (relating to protests), and part <PRTPAGE P="365"/>175 (relating to petitions filed by American manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers pursuant to section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended). Nor do the provisions of part 177 apply to requests for decisions of an operational, administrative, or investigative nature which are properly within the cognizance of a CBP Headquarters Office other than Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 177.1</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General ruling practice and definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">The issuance of rulings generally</E>—(1) <E T="03">Prospective transactions.</E> It is in the interest of the sound administration of the Customs and related laws that persons engaging in any transaction affected by those laws fully understand the consequences of that transaction prior to its consummation. For this reason, the Customs Service will give full and careful consideration to written requests from importers and other interested parties for rulings or information setting forth, with respect to a specifically described transaction, a definitive interpretation of applicable law, or other appropriate information. Generally, a ruling may be requested under the provisions of this part only with respect to prospective transactions—that is, transactions which are not already pending before a Customs Service office by reason of arrival, entry, or otherwise.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Current or completed transactions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Current transactions.</E> A question arising in connection with a Customs transaction already before a Customs Service office will normally be resolved by that office in accordance with the principles and precedents previously announced by the Headquarters Office. If such a question cannot be resolved on the basis of clearly established rules set forth in the Customs and related laws, or in the regulations thereunder, or in applicable Treasury Decisions, rulings, opinions, or court decisions published in the Customs Bulletin, that office may be requested to forward the question to the Headquarters Office for consideration, as more fully described in § 177.11.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Completed transactions.</E> A question arising in connection with an entry of merchandise which has been liquidated, or in connection with any other completed Customs transaction, may not be the subject of a ruling request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Oral advice.</E> The Customs Service will not issue rulings in response to oral requests. Oral opinions or advice of Customs Service personnel are not binding on the Customs Service. However, oral inquiries may be made to Customs Service offices regarding existing rulings, the scope of such rulings, the types of transactions with respect to which the Customs Service will issue rulings, the scope of the rulings which may be issued, or the procedures to be followed in submitting ruling requests, as described in this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Who may request a ruling.</E> Except as otherwise provided in subpart I of part 181 of this chapter, a ruling may be requested under this part by any person who, as an importer or exporter of merchandise, or otherwise, has a direct and demonstrable interest in the question or questions presented in the ruling request, or by the authorized agent of such person. A “person” in this context includes an individual, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity or group.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) A “ruling” is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the appropriate office of Customs as provided in this part that interprets and applies the provisions of the Customs and related laws to a specific set of facts. A “ruling letter” is a ruling issued in response to a written request therefor and set forth in a letter addressed to the person making the request or his designee. A “published ruling” is a ruling which has been published in the Customs Bulletin.</P>

            <P>(2) An “information letter” is a written statement issued by the Customs Service that does no more than call attention to a well-established interpretation or principle of Customs law, without applying it to a specific set of facts. An information letter may be issued in response to a request for a <PRTPAGE P="366"/>ruling when: (i) The request suggests that general information, rather than a ruling, is actually being sought, (ii) the request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in this part, or (iii) the ruling requested cannot be issued for any other reason, and (iv) it is believed that general information may be of some benefit to the party making the request.</P>
            <P>(3) A “Customs transaction” is an act or activity to which the Customs and related laws apply. A “prospective” Customs transaction is one that is contemplated or is currently being undertaken and has not resulted in any arrival or the filing of any entry or other document, or in any other act to bring the transaction, or any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs Service office. A “current” Customs transaction is one which is presently under consideration by a port office of the Customs Service. A “completed” Customs transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs Service field office and with respect to which that office has issued a determination which is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to appeal, petition, protest, or other review, as provided in the applicable Customs laws and regulations. In a series of identical, recurring transactions, each transaction shall be considered an individual transaction for purposes of this part.</P>
            <P>(4) An “authorized agent” is a person expressly authorized by a principal to act on his behalf. A ruling requested by an attorney or other person acting as an agent must include a statement describing the authority under which the request is made. With the exception of attorneys whose authority to represent is known, any person appearing before the Customs Service as an agent in connection with a ruling request may be required to present evidence of his authority to represent the principal. The foregoing requirements will not apply to an individual representing his full-time employer, or to a bona-fide officer, director, or other qualified representative of a corporation, association, or organized group.</P>
            <P>(5) The term “Customs and related laws,” as generally used in this part, includes any provision of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (including the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), or the Customs Regulations, or any provision contained in other legislation (including the navigation laws), regulations, treaties, orders, proclamations, or other agreements administered by the Customs Service.</P>
            <P>(6) The term “Headquarters Office,” as used herein, means the Regulations and Rulings, Office of international Trade at Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC.</P>
            <CITA>[T.D. 75-186, 40 FR 31929, July 30, 1975, as amended by T.D. 80-285, 45 FR 80104, Dec. 3, 1980; T.D. 84-149, 49 FR 28699, July 16, 1984; T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51271, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 89-74, 54 FR 31515, July 31, 1989; T.D. 94-1, 58 FR 69473, Dec. 30, 1993]</CITA>

            <SECTNO>§ 177.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Submission of ruling requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Form.</E> A request for a ruling should be in the form of a letter. Requests for Valuation and Carrier rulings should be addressed to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229. The Division and Branch in the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, to which the request should be directed may also be indicated, if known. Requests for tariff classification rulings should be addressed to the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 201 Varick Street, Suite 501, New York, New York 10014.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Content</E>—(1) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Each request for a ruling must contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the transaction. Such facts include the names, addresses, and other identifying information of all interested parties (if known); the name of the port or place at which any article involved in the transaction will arrive or be entered, or which will otherwise have jurisdiction with respect to the act or activity described in the transaction; and a description of the transaction itself, appropriate in detail to the type of ruling requested.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Description of transaction</E>—(i) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The Customs transaction to which the ruling request relates must <PRTPAGE P="367"/>be described in sufficient detail to permit the proper application of relevant customs and related laws.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tariff classification rulings.</E> (A) If the transaction involves the importation of an article for which a ruling as to its proper classification under the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is requested, the request for a ruling should include a full and complete description of the article and whenever germane to the proper classification of the article, information as to the article's chief use in the United States, its commercial, common, or technical designation, and, where the article is composed of two or more materials, the relative quantity (by weight and by volume) and value of each. The ruling request should also note, whenever germane, the purchase price of the article, and its approximate selling price in the United States. Individual requests for rulings submitted to service port offices will be limited to five (5) merchandise items, all of which must be of the same class or kind.</P>
            <P>(B) Rulings issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, or any service port office are limited to prospective transactions. Only the Headquarters Office will prepare final decisions under § 177.11 (Requests for Advice by Field Officers), or § 174.23 (Further Review of Protests), § 177.10 (Change of Practice), decisions under part 175 of this chapter (petitions under section 516, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended), decisions under § 177.13 (Inconsistent Customs decisions), and decisions under Policies and Procedures Manual Supplement 2126-01.</P>
            <P>(C) The requesting party may send the request directly to the Director, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. The Headquarters Office retains authority to independently review all tariff classification ruling letters issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, and any service port office. If the importer or other person to whom a ruling letter is issued disagrees with the tariff classification set forth in a ruling issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, or any service port office, he may petition the Director, Commercial Rulings Division, U.S. Customs Service, Washington, DC 20229, for review of the ruling.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Valuation rulings.</E> If the transaction involves the valuation of an article for Customs purposes, the request for a ruling should include all of the applicable information described in subpart C of part 152 of this chapter, and, insofar as is relevant, the information which would be required on an invoice as described in subpart F of part 141 of this chapter. The request should also describe the nature of the transaction (whether f.o.b./c.i.f., ex-factory, or some other arrangement), the relationship (if any) of the parties, whether the transaction was at arm's-length, whether there have been other sales of the same or similar merchandise in the country of exportation, whether an agency relationship exists, or any other information relevant to a determination under section 402 or 402a of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a, 1402).</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Carrier rulings.</E> If the transaction involves a vessel, the request for a ruling should include information relating to place of build and nationality of registration and, if to be used in waters under the jurisdiction of the United States, the exact place or places of intended use, if known. If the request for a ruling involves a determination as to whether or not the primary object of a contemplated voyage would be considered to be coastwise transportation in violation of 46 U.S.C. 289 (see § 4.80a of this chapter), the request should completely identify the voyage, including the proposed time of arrival at and departure from every port on the itinerary and any coordination of the voyage with special events at coastwise ports, and should be accompanied by samples, if available, of brochures, advertising, and other information that may be relevant to a determination of the primary object of the proposed voyage.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Samples.</E> Each request for a ruling regarding the status of an article under any Customs or related law affecting the importation or arrival of that article should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial <PRTPAGE P="368"/>representations of the article and, whenever possible, by a sample article, unless a precise description of the article is not essential to the ruling requested. Any article consisting of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis. A sample submitted in connection with a request for a ruling becomes a part of the Customs Service file in the matter and will be retained until the ruling is issued or the ruling request is otherwise disposed of. If the return of the sample is desired, the ruling request should so state and should specify the desired means of return. A sample should only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other actions undertaken in connection with the ruling request.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Related documents.</E> If the question or questions presented in the ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any invoice, contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document must be submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be submitted inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the ruling request become a part of the Customs Service file in the matter and cannot be returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted, and an explanation of their bearing on the question or questions presented, must be expressly set forth in the ruling request.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Prior or current transactions.</E> Each request for a ruling must state whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the same transaction, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered by any Customs Service office or whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the issues involved have ever been considered, or are currently being considered, by the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Where the transaction described in the ruling request is but one of a series of similar and related transactions, that fact must also be stated.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Statement of position.</E> If the request for a ruling asks that a particular determination or conclusion be reached in the ruling letter, a statement must be included in the request setting forth the basis for that determination or conclusion, together with a citation of all relevant supporting authority.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Privileged or confidential information.</E> Information which is claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party), must be identified clearly and the reasons such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party) must be set forth.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Signing; instructions as to reply.</E> The request for a ruling must be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as described in § 177.1(c). A ruling requested by a principal or authorized agent may direct that the ruling letter be addressed to the other.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Requests for immediate consideration.</E> The Customs Service will normally process requests for rulings in the order they are received and as expeditiously as possible. However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram will be treated in the same manner as requests made by letter, but rulings will not ordinarily be issued by telegram. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular request for a ruling will be acted upon by the time requested. However, upon request and where a clear need is shown for such action, a collect telephone call will be <PRTPAGE P="369"/>made to advise that the ruling letter has been issued and is being mailed.</P>

            <P>A person submitting a request for a ruling that does not comply with all of the provisions of this part will be so notified in writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be pointed out. Except in the case of ruling requests submitted to Area or District offices, such person will be given a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may provide) to supply any additional information that is requested or otherwise conform the ruling request to the requirements referred to in the notice. The Customs Service file with respect to ruling requests which are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this part within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and the request removed from active consideration until such time as the deficiencies cited in the notice are corrected. A request for a ruling that is removed from active consideration by reason of failing to comply with the provisions of this part may be treated as withdrawn. In the case of ruling requests made to Area or District offices, a failure to comply with the provisions of this part will result in the return of the ruling request with the notice specifying the deficiencies and such requests will not be considered as having been filed until such deficiencies are corrected.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Oral discussion of issues.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> A person submitting a request for a ruling and desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved should indicate that desire in writing at the time the ruling request is filed. Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the ruling request is under consideration, a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue or issues involved or when a determination or conclusion contrary to that advocated in the ruling request is contemplated. Conferences are scheduled for the purpose of affording the parties an opportunity to freely and openly discuss the matters set forth in the ruling request. Accordingly, the parties will not be bound by any argument or position advocated or agreed to, expressly or by implication, during the conference unless either party subsequently agrees to be so bound in writing. The conference will not conclude with the issuance of a ruling letter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Time, place, and number of conferences.</E> If a request for a conference is granted, the person making the request will be notified of the time and place of the conference. No more than one conference with respect to the matters set forth in a ruling request will be scheduled, unless, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the ruling request is under consideration, additional conferences are necessary.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Representation.</E> A person whose request for a conference has been granted may be accompanied at that conference by counsel or other representatives, or may designate such persons to attend the conference in his place.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional information presented at conferences.</E> It will be the responsibility of the person submitting the request for a ruling to provide for inclusion in the Customs Service file in the matter a written record setting forth any and all additional information, documents, and exhibits introduced during the conference to the extent that person considers such material relevant to the consideration of the ruling request.</P>

In particular, the Customs Service office to which the request was made must be advised when any transaction described in the ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service field office. In addition, any person engaged in a Customs transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service field office and having previously requested a ruling with respect to that transaction shall advise the field office of that fact.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Ruling letters</E>—(1) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The Customs Service will endeavor to issue a ruling letter setting forth a determination with respect to a specifically described Customs transaction whenever a request for such a ruling is submitted in accordance with the provisions of this part and it is in the sound administration of the Customs and related laws to do so. Otherwise, a request for a ruling will be answered by an information letter or, in those situations in which general information is likely to be of little or no value, by a letter stating that no ruling can be issued.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submission of ruling letters to field offices.</E> Any person engaging in a Customs transaction with respect to which a binding tariff classification ruling letter (including pre-entry classification decisions) has been issued under this part shall ascertain that a copy of the ruling letter is attached to the documents filed with the appropriate Customs Service office in connection with that transaction, or shall otherwise indicate with the information filed for that transaction that a ruling has been received. Any person receiving a ruling setting forth the tariff classification of merchandise shall set forth such classification in the documents or information filed in connection with any subsequent entry of that merchandise; the failure to do so may result in a rejection of the entry and the imposition of such penalties as may be appropriate. A ruling received after the filing of such documents or information shall <PRTPAGE P="371"/>immediately be brought to the attention of the appropriate Customs Service field office.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Disclosure of ruling letters.</E> The ruling letter shall be based on the information set forth in the ruling request. No part of the ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information relating to the business transactions of private parties, shall be deemed to constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), unless, as provided in § 177.2(b)(7), the information claimed to be exempt from disclosure is clearly identified and the reasons for the exemption are set forth. Before the issuance of the ruling letter, the person submitting the ruling request, will be notified of any decision adverse to his claim for exemption from disclosure and will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working days of the date of notification, be permitted to withdraw the ruling request. All ruling letters issued by the Customs Service will be available, upon written request, for inspection and copying by any person (with any portions determined to be exempt from disclosure deleted).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Effect of ruling letters.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Effect of ruling letters generally.</E> A ruling letter issued by the Customs Service under the provisions of this part represents the official position of the Customs Service with respect to the particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs Service personnel in accordance with the provisions of this section until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the ruling set forth in the ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority in the disposition of transactions involving the same circumstances. Generally, a ruling letter is effective on the date it is issued and may be applied to all entries which are unliquidated, or other transactions with respect to which the Customs Service has not taken final action on that date. See, however, § 177.10(e) (changes of practice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>) and § 177.12 (rulings which modify or revoke previous rulings, decisions, or treatments).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Application of rulings to transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Each ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the information furnished in connection with the ruling request and incorporated in the ruling letter, either directly, by reference, or by implication, is accurate and complete in every material respect. The application of a ruling letter by a Customs Service field office to the transaction to which it is purported to relate is subject to the verification of the facts incorporated in the ruling letter, a comparison of the transaction described therein to the actual transaction, and the satisfaction of any conditions on which the ruling was based. If, in the opinion of any Customs Service field office by whom the transaction is under consideration or review, the ruling letter should be modified or revoked, the findings and recommendations of that office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration, as provided in § 177.11(b)(1)(i), prior to any final disposition with respect to the transaction by that office. Otherwise, if the transaction described in the ruling letter and the actual transaction are the same, and any and all conditions set forth in the ruling letter have been satisfied, the ruling will be applied to the transaction.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Tariff classification rulings.</E> Each ruling letter setting forth the proper classification of an article under the <PRTPAGE P="372"/>provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States will be applied only with respect to transactions involving articles identical to the sample submitted with the ruling request or to articles whose description is identical to the description set forth in the ruling letter.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Valuation rulings.</E> Each ruling letter setting forth the proper valuation of an article under the provisions of section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a), will be applied only with respect to transactions involving the same merchandise and like facts.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Carrier rulings.</E> Each ruling letter setting forth the applicability of the navigation laws to a vessel will be applied only with respect to transactions involving operations identical to those set forth in the ruling letter. Each ruling letter setting forth a determination as to whether or not the primary object of a contemplated voyage is coastwise transportation in violation of 46 U.S.C. 289 will be binding on the United States Customs Service with respect to any transaction identical to the facts and circumstances described in the ruling request and undertaken in reliance on the ruling letter.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reliance on ruling letters by others.</E> Except when public notice and comment procedures apply under § 177.12, a ruling letter is subject to modification or revocation by CBP without notice to any person other than the person to whom the ruling letter was addressed. Accordingly, no other person should rely on the ruling letter or assume that the principles of that ruling will be applied in connection with any transaction other than the one described in the letter. However, any person eligible to request a ruling under § 177.1(c) may request information as to whether a previously-issued ruling letter has been modified or revoked by writing the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229, and either enclosing a copy of the ruling letter or furnishing other information sufficient to permit the ruling letter in question to be identified.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Advice or guidance as to the interpretation or proper application of the Customs and related laws with respect to a specific Customs transaction may be requested by Customs Service field offices from the Headquarters Office at any time, whether the transaction is prospective, current, or completed. Advice as to the proper application of the Customs and related laws to a current transaction will be sought by a Customs Service field office whenever that office is requested to do so, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, by an importer or other person having an interest in the transaction. Advice or guidance will be furnished by the Headquarters Office as a means of assisting Customs personnel in the orderly processing of Customs transactions under consideration by them and to insure the consistent application of the Customs and related laws in the several Customs districts. Requests for advice received by the Headquarters Office will be processed as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Certain current transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">When a ruling has been issued</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requests by field offices.</E> If any Customs Service office has issued a ruling letter with respect to a particular Customs transaction and the Customs Service field office having jurisdiction over that transaction believes that the ruling should be modified or revoked, the field office will forward to the Headquarters Office, pursuant to § 177.9(b)(1), a request that the ruling be reconsidered. The field office will notify the importer or other person to whom the ruling letter was issued, in writing, that it has requested the Headquarters Office to reconsider the ruling.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Requests by importers and others.</E> If the importer or other person to whom a ruling letter is issued disagrees with the Customs Service field office having jurisdiction over the transaction to which the ruling relates as to the proper application of the ruling to the transaction, the field office will, upon receipt of a written request submitted in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, request advice from the Headquarters Office as to the proper application of the ruling to the transaction. Such advice may not be requested for the purpose of seeking reconsideration of a ruling with which the importer or other person to whom the ruling letter was issued disagrees.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">When no ruling has been issued.</E> Internal advice will be sought by a Customs Service field office with respect to a current transaction for which no ruling was requested or issued under the provisions of this part whenever a difference of opinion exists as to the interpretation or proper application of the Customs and related laws to the transaction, and the field office is requested to seek such advice by an importer or other person who would have been entitled, under § 177.1(c), to request a ruling with respect to the transaction, while prospective. The request must be submitted to the field office in writing and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Form of request by importers and others.</E> An importer or other person requesting that a Customs Service field office seek advice from the Headquarters Office must make such a request, in writing, to the field office having jurisdiction over the transaction in question. The request shall contain a complete statement setting forth a description of the transaction, the specific questions presented, the applicable law, and an argument for the conclusions advocated. The statement must also specify whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the statement, the same transaction, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered, by any Customs Service office. In addition, the statement should indicate at which port or ports of entry identical or substantially identical merchandise has been entered.<PRTPAGE P="374"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Review of requests by importers and others.</E> All requests submitted by importers and other persons under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will be reviewed by the field office to which they are submitted. In the event a difference of opinion exists as to the description of the transaction or as to the point or points at issue, the person submitting the request will be so advised in writing. If agreement cannot be reached, both the statements of the person submitting the request and the field office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Refusal by Headquarters Office to furnish advice.</E> The Headquarters Office may refuse to consider the questions presented to it in the form of a request for internal advice whenever (i) the Headquarters Office determines that the period of time necessary to give adequate consideration to the questions presented would result in a withholding of action with respect to the transaction, or in any other situation, that is inconsistent with the sound administration of the Customs and related laws, and (ii) the questions presented can subsequently be raised by the importer or other interested party in the form of a protest filed in accordance with the provisions of part 174 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Effect of advice received from the Headquarters Office.</E> Advice furnished by the Headquarters Office in response to a request therefor represents the official position of the Customs Service as to the application of the Customs laws to the facts of a specific transaction. If the field office believes that the advice furnished by the Headquarters Office should be reconsidered, it shall promptly request such reconsideration. Otherwise, the advice furnished by the Headquarters Office will be applied by the field office in its disposition of the Customs transaction in question.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Publication.</E> Within 90 days after issuing an internal advice memorandum, the Customs Service shall publish the decision in the Customs Bulletin or otherwise make it available for public inspection. Disclosure is governed by 31 CFR part 1 and 19 CFR part 103.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Judicial review of importers' requests.</E> A refusal by the Headquarters Office to consider the questions raised by an importer in the form of a request for internal advice may be appealed to the Court of International Trade if the importer demonstrates to the Court that he would be irreparably harmed unless given an opportunity to obtain judicial review prior to the importation of the merchandise.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Modification or revocation of interpretive rulings, protest review decisions, and previous treatment of substantially identical transactions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An interpretive ruling, which includes an internal advice decision, issued under this part, or a holding or principle covered by a protest review decision issued under part 174 of this chapter, if found to be in error or not in accord with the current views of Customs, may be modified or revoked by an interpretive ruling issued under this section. In addition, an interpretive ruling issued under this section may have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions. A modification or revocation under this section must be carried out in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, and the modification or revocation will take effect as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Interpretive rulings or protest review decisions.</E> Customs may modify or revoke an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that has been in effect for less than 60 calendar days by simply giving written notice of the modification or revocation to the person to whom the original ruling was issued or whose current transaction was the subject of the internal advice decision or, in the case of a protest review decision, to the <PRTPAGE P="375"/>person identified on the Customs Form 19 as the protestant or to any other person designated to receive notice of denial of a protest under § 174.30(b) of this chapter. However, when Customs contemplates the issuance of an interpretive ruling that would modify or revoke an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision which has been in effect for 60 or more calendar days, the following procedures will apply:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Publication of proposed action.</E> A notice proposing the modification or revocation and inviting public comment on the proposal will be published in the <E T="03">Customs Bulletin.</E> The notice will refer to all previously issued interpretive rulings or protest review decisions that Customs has identified as being the subject of the proposed action and will invite any member of the public who has received another interpretive ruling or protest review decision involving the issue that is the subject of the proposed action to advise Customs of that fact. Interested parties will have 30 calendar days from the date of publication of the notice to submit written comments on the proposed modification or revocation and to advise Customs in writing that they are recipients of an affected interpretive ruling or protest review decision that was not identified in the notice.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of final action.</E> In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, within 30 calendar days after the close of the public comment period, any submitted comments will be considered and a final modifying or revoking notice or notice of other appropriate final action on the proposed modification or revocation will be published in the <E T="03">Customs Bulletin.</E> In addition, a written decision will be issued to the person to whom, or on whose transaction, the original interpretive ruling was issued or, in the case of a protest review decision, to the person identified on the Customs Form 19 as the protestant or to any other person designated to receive notice of denial of a protest under § 174.30(b) of this chapter. Publication of a final modifying or revoking notice in the <E T="03">Customs Bulletin</E> will have the effect of modifying or revoking any interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that involves merchandise or an issue that is substantially identical in all material respects to the merchandise or issue that is the subject of the modification or revocation, including an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that is not specifically identified in the final modifying or revoking notice.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Treatment previously accorded to substantially identical transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The issuance of an interpretive ruling that has the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions must be in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The following rules will apply for purposes of determining under this section whether a treatment was previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions of a person:</P>
            <P>(i) There must be evidence to establish that:</P>
            <P>(A) There was an actual determination by a Customs officer regarding the facts and issues involved in the claimed treatment;</P>
            <P>(B) The Customs officer making the actual determination was responsible for the subject matter on which the determination was made; and</P>
            <P>(C) Over a 2-year period immediately preceding the claim of treatment, Customs consistently applied that determination on a national basis as reflected in liquidations of entries or reconciliations or other Customs actions with respect to all or substantially all of that person's Customs transactions involving materially identical facts and issues;</P>

            <P>(ii) The determination of whether the requisite treatment occurred will be made by Customs on a case-by-case basis and will involve an assessment of all relevant factors. In particular, Customs will focus on the past transactions to determine whether there was an examination of the merchandise (where applicable) by Customs or the extent to which those transactions were otherwise reviewed by Customs to determine the proper application of the Customs laws and regulations. For purposes of establishing whether the requisite treatment occurred, Customs <PRTPAGE P="376"/>will give diminished weight to transactions involving small quantities or values, and Customs will give no weight whatsoever to informal entries and to other entries or transactions which Customs, in the interest of commercial facilitation and accommodation, processes expeditiously and without examination or Customs officer review;</P>
            <P>(iii) Customs will not find that a treatment was accorded to a person's transactions if:</P>
            <P>(A) The person's own transactions were not accorded the treatment in question over the 2-year period immediately preceding the claim of treatment;</P>
            <P>(B) The issue in question involves the admissibility of merchandise;</P>
            <P>(C) The person made a material false statement or material omission in connection with a Customs transaction or in connection with the review of a Customs transaction and that statement or omission affected the determination on which the treatment claim is based; or</P>
            <P>(D) Customs advised the person regarding the manner in which the transactions should be presented to Customs and the person failed to follow that advice; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The evidentiary burden as regards the existence of the previous treatment is on the person claiming that treatment. The evidence of previous treatment by Customs must include a list of all materially identical transactions by entry number (or other Customs assigned number), the quantity and value of merchandise covered by each transaction (where applicable), the ports of entry, the dates of final action by Customs, and, if known, the name and location of the Customs officer who made the determination on which the claimed treatment is based. In addition, in cases in which an entry is liquidated without any Customs review (for example, the entry is liquidated automatically as entered), the person claiming a previous treatment must be prepared to submit to Customs written or other appropriate evidence of the earlier actual determination of a Customs officer that the person relied on in preparing the entry and that is consistent with the liquidation of the entry.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice procedures</E>—(i) When Customs has reason to believe that a contemplated interpretive ruling would have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions, notice of the intent to modify or revoke that treatment will be published in the <E T="03">Customs Bulletin</E> either as a separate action or in connection with a proposed modification or revocation of an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The notice will give interested parties 30 calendar days from the date of publication of the notice to submit written comments on the proposed modification or revocation and will invite any member of the public whose substantially identical transactions have been accorded the same treatment to advise Customs in writing of that fact, supported by appropriate details regarding those transactions, within that 30-day period. Within 30 calendar days after the close of the public comment period, any submitted comments will be considered, notice of the final interpretive ruling or other final action on the proposed modification or revocation will be published in the <E T="03">Customs Bulletin.</E> Written confirmation of the applicability of a final modification or revocation will be sent to each person identified as having had substantially identical transactions that were accorded the same treatment.</P>

            <P>(ii) If Customs is not aware prior to issuance that a contemplated interpretive ruling would have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions, the interpretive ruling will be issued and generally will be effective as provided in § 177.9. However, Customs will, upon written application by a person claiming that the interpretive ruling has the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to his substantially identical transactions, consider delaying the effective date of the interpretive ruling <PRTPAGE P="377"/>with respect to that person, and continue the treatment previously accorded the substantially identical transactions, pending completion of the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Publication and issuance not required.</E> The publication and issuance requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are inapplicable in circumstances in which a Customs position is modified, revoked or otherwise materially affected by operation of law or by publication pursuant to other legal authority or by other appropriate action taken by Customs in furtherance of an order, instruction or other policy decision of another governmental agency or entity pursuant to statutory or delegated authority. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Adoption or amendment of a statutory provision, including any change to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States;</P>
            <P>(ii) Promulgation of a treaty or other international agreement under the foreign affairs function of the United States;</P>
            <P>(iii) Issuance of a Presidential Proclamation or Executive Order, or issuance of a decision or policy determination pursuant to authority delegated by the President;</P>
            <P>(iv) Subject to the provisions of § 152.16 of this chapter, the rendering of a judicial decision which has the effect of overturning the Customs position;</P>
            <P>(v) Publication of a decision in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a result of a petition by a domestic interested party pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516 (see part 175 of this chapter);</P>
            <P>(vi) Publication of an interim or final rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553;</P>

            <P>(vii) Publication of a final interpretative rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 following public notice and comment procedures; and</P>
            <P>(viii) Publication of a final ruling in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1315(d) and § 177.10(c) relating to change of established and uniform practice.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Publication not required.</E> In the following circumstances a final modifying or revoking ruling will be issued to the person entitled to it under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section but <E T="03">Customs Bulletin</E> publication under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is not required:</P>
            <P>(i) The modifying ruling corrects a clerical error; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The modifying or revoking ruling is directed to a ruling issued under subpart I of part 181 of this chapter relating to advance rulings under the North American Free Trade Agreement.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Effective date and application to transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rulings or decisions in effect for less than 60 days.</E> If an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that is modified or revoked under this section had been in effect for less than 60 calendar days, the modifying or revoking interpretive ruling:</P>
            <P>(i) Will be effective on its date of issuance with respect to the specific transaction covered by the modifying or revoking interpretive ruling: and</P>
            <P>(ii) Will be applicable to merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after its date of issuance.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rulings or decisions in effect for 60 or more days.</E> If an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that is modified or revoked under this section had been in effect for 60 or more calendar days, the modifying or revoking notice will, provided that liquidation of the entry in question has not become final, apply to merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Inconsistent CBP decisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Certain decisions made by CBP officials at one field location which are inconsistent with decisions being made by CBP officials at another location may be brought to the attention of CBP Headquarters for resolution by a petition filed by an interested party. The types of decisions which may be the subject of such a petition, a description of the parties who qualify as interested parties, and the period of time in which the petition may be filed are set forth below.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Inconsistent decisions subject to petition.</E> The decisions which may be the subject of a petition include:</P>
            <P>(i) Decisions described in section 514(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)), made with respect to the same, or substantially similar, merchandise; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Repeated decisions to conduct intensified inspections or examinations of merchandise at ports of entry.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Interested Parties.</E> The following parties will be considered interested parties entitled to file a petition under this section:</P>
            <P>(i) Parties described in section 514(c)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(c)(2)), as eligible to file a protest under section 514;</P>
            <P>(ii) A port authority; and</P>
            <P>(iii) An “interested party,” as described in section 516(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1516(a)(2)).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Time for filing.</E> In the case of decisions described in section 514(a) of the Tariff Act, the petition must be filed within the time prescribed by section 514(c)(2), for filing a protest with respect to the later (or latest) of the decisions which are the subject of the petition. In the case of repeated decisions to conduct intensified inspections or examinations of merchandise at ports of entry, the petition must be filed within ninety (90) days of the later (or latest) such decision.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Petition</E>—(1) <E T="03">Form.</E> The petition must be in the form of a letter addressed to the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229-0001. Three copies of the petition should be submitted, if possible.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Content.</E> The petition should contain a complete description of the inconsistent decisions complained of, including the ports of entry (or other CBP office) where the decisions were made, entry numbers, and the dates (or approximate dates) such decisions were made. The information set forth in the petition must be sufficient to demonstrate the inconsistency of the decisions described and that the merchandise, or circumstances in which the allegedly inconsistent decisions were made, were substantially similar. In the case of repeated decisions regarding the inspection or examination of merchandise, the decisions must be sufficient in number to demonstrate a pattern of inconsistency not attributable to random selection. Any information which the petitioner considers to be confidential business information should be so noted pursuant to § 177.2(b)(7) of this subpart and a sanitized version of his petition should be submitted as well as the three copies requested in paragraph (b)(1) of this <PRTPAGE P="379"/>section. Petitions which do not contain information sufficient to permit the CBP to verify that the decisions described have occurred will not be considered properly filed and will be returned to the petitioner for additional information. Only one petition will be accepted by the CBP with respect to the decisions alleged to be inconsistent.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Tariff classification decision.</E> In the case of decisions involving the tariff classification of merchandise, the petition should also include, with respect to each of the decisions described, the information requested in § 177.2 (b)(1) and (b)(2)(ii) of this subpart, including a sample (see § 177.2(b)(3)).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other subjects addressable by administrative rulings.</E> In the case of other decisions involving subjects which could be addressed under the administrative rulings procedure provided for in §§ 177.1 through 177.10 of this subpart, the information contained in § 177.2 (b)(1), (b)(2)(iii) and/or (b)(2)(iv), as applicable, should be also furnished for each of the decisions addressed by the petition.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Publication and public comment.</E> Upon receipt of a properly filed petition, notice will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing the receipt of the petition and describing the decisions alleged to be inconsistent. Public comment on the petition will be permitted for a period of fifteen (15) days after publication. Public comment regarding the proper disposition of the petition will be limited to that submitted in writing, either with the petition or in response to the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> solicitation of public comment.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of petition; distribution and publication.</E> Within fifteen (15) days after the close of the period for public comment referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, CBP will issue a decision to the petitioner addressing the inconsistency complained of. That decision will either conform the inconsistent decisions to the current views of CBP as to the proper tariff classification or other disposition of the subject of those decisions or explain why no inconsistency exists. Copies of the decisions to the petitioner will be transmitted directly to all ports (or other CBP offices) identified in the petition and will be distributed through the Customs Information Exchange or by other means to such other ports or offices as may be necessary to correct any inconsistency identified. A summary of the decision will also be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the weekly Customs Bulletin.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> Unless otherwise specified in the decision, a decision issued in response to a petition filed under this section will be effective immediately and, where applicable, applied to all entries for which liquidation is not final.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Effect on other procedures.</E> The filing of a petition under this procedure will not preclude the petitioner or any other person entitled to do so from filing a protest or a domestic interested party petition regarding the same matter under the procedures set forth in sections 514, 515 and 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended and parts 174 and 175 of this chapter, provided the applicable requirements set forth therein are complied with. However, the decision issued in response to the petition may serve as the basis for the disposition of any protest so filed, or as an information letter setting forth the position of the CBP pursuant to subpart A of part 175 of this chapter. The decision issued in response to a petition filed under this section is not itself a decision subject to protest under sections 514-515 of the Tariff Act and part 174 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>This subpart applies to the issuance of country-of-origin advisory rulings and final determinations relating to <PRTPAGE P="380"/>Government procurement under Title III, “Trade Agreements Act of 1979,” Pub.

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Country of origin.</E> For the purpose of this subpart, an article is a product of a country or instrumentality only if (1) it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of that country or instrumentality, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality, it has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term “instrumentality” shall not be construed to include any agency or division of the government of a country, but may be construed to include such arrangements as the European Economic Community.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Advisory ruling.</E> An advisory ruling is a non-binding, non-reviewable written statement issued by the Director, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border protection, which does no more than call attention to a well established interpretation or principal of law relating to the country of origin, without applying it to a particular set of facts. CBP will issue an advisory ruling in response to a request for a final determination if:</P>
            <P>(1) The request suggests that general information, rather than a final determination, is actually being sought,</P>
            <P>(2) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in § 177.25(a), or</P>
            <P>(3) The ruling requested cannot be issued for any other reason, and CBP believes that the general information supplied by an advisory ruling may be of some benefit to the party making the request. An advisory ruling is not a ruling issued prior to importation under 28 U.S.C. 1581(h).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Final determination.</E> A final determination is a binding judicially reviewable statement issued by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in response to a written request submitted under the provisions of this subpart that interprets and applies the provisions of law and regulation relating to the country of origin to a specific set of facts. A final determination may be issued to a party-at-interest prior to actual entry of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Party-at-interest.</E> For purposes of this subpart the term party-at-interest means:</P>
            <P>(1) A foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or a United States importer of merchandise which is the subject of a final determination under this subpart,</P>
            <P>(2) A manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of a like product,</P>
            <P>(3) United States members of a labor organization or other association of workers whose members are employed in the manufacture, production, or wholesale in the United States of a like product, and</P>

A Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under this paragraph or under § 181.32(b)(3) of this part:</P>

If the Center director determines that a Certificate is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer shall be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. Acceptance of a Certificate will result in the granting of preferential tariff treatment to the imported good unless, in connection with an origin verification initiated under subpart G of this part or based on a pattern of conduct within the meaning of § 181.76(c) of this part, the Center director determines that the imported good does not qualify as an originating good or should not be accorded such treatment for any other reason as specifically provided for elsewhere in this part. A Certificate shall not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section if, based on an origin verification under subpart G of this part, the Center director determined that a previously imported identical good covered by the Certificate did not qualify as an originating good.</P>

            <P>(iii) A commercial importation for which the total value of originating goods does not exceed US$2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement:

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except in the case of goods specified in § 181.45 of this part, drawback of the duties previously paid upon importation of a good into the United States may be granted by the United States, upon presentation of a NAFTA drawback claim under this subpart, on the lower amount of:</P>
            <P>(1) The total duties paid or owed on the good in the United States; or</P>
            <P>(2) The total amount of duties paid on the exported good upon subsequent importation into Canada or Mexico.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Individual relative value and duty comparison principle.</E> For purposes of this section, relative value shall be determined, and the comparison between the duties referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the duties referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be made, separately with reference to each individual exported good, including where two components or materials are used to produce one exported good or one component or material is divided among multiple exported goods.

              <P>Upon importation of Chemical X into the United States, Company A entered <PRTPAGE P="395"/>Chemical X and paid $2.00 in duties. Company A processed Chemical X into Products Y and Z, each having the same relative value; that is, $1.00 in duty is attributable to Product Y and $1.00 in duty is attributable to Product Z. Company A exported Product Y to Canada and Canada assessed a free rate of duty. Company A exported Product Z to Mexico and Mexico assessed the equivalent of US$2.00 in duty. There is no entitlement to drawback on the export of Product Y to Canada because zero is the lesser amount when compared to the $1.00 in duty attributable to Product Y as a result of the separation of Chemical X into Products Y and Z. There would be entitlement to drawback on the export to Mexico, consisting of the $1.00 duty attributable to Product Z, because that amount is the lesser amount when comparing the duty paid to the United States and the US$ equivalent duty paid to Mexico.</P>

              <P>Upon the importation of Product X to the United States from Japan, Company A paid $2.00 in duties. Company A manufactured the imported Product X into Product Y, and subsequently exported it to Mexico. Mexico assessed the equivalent of US$11.00 in duties upon importation of Product Y. Upon presenting a drawback claim in the United States, in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(a), Company A would be entitled to a refund of 99 percent of the $2.00, or $1.98. The $2.00 paid by Company A (less 1 percent) on the importation of Product X into the United States is a lesser amount of duties than the total amount of customs duties paid to Mexico (the equivalent of US$11.00) on Product Y.</P>

Company A manufactured Product X into Product Y, sold it to Company B in Mexico and subsequently exported it to Mexico. Company A reserved its right to drawback. Upon Product Y's importation, Company B was assessed a free rate of duty. Company A's claim for drawback will be denied because Company A is entitled to zero drawback for the reason that, as between the duty paid in the United States and the duty paid in Mexico, the duty in Mexico was zero.</P>

For purposes of drawback under this subpart, the term “same kind and quality” used in § 1313(b) (see § 191.2(x)(1) of this chapter) shall have the same meaning as the term “identical or similar good” used in Article 303 of the NAFTA except that there shall be no requirement that the good be manufactured in the same country.

Company A substituted a same kind and quality domestic Product X for the Japanese Product X in its production of Product Y under its 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) drawback contract. Company A sold Product Y to Company B which subsequently exported it to Canada. On the importation of Product Y by Company B, Company B paid the equivalent of US$2.00 in duties assessed by Revenue Canada and waived its right to drawback to Company A. Company A is entitled to obtain drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) in the United States in the amount of $1.98 (or 99 percent of the US$2.00 equivalent Company B paid in duty to Canada) since that $2.00 was the lesser of the total amount of customs duties paid on the product to either Canada or the United States.</P>

Company A is entitled to obtain $4.95 in drawback (a refund of 99 percent of $5.00 paid to the United States).

Company Z is entitled to drawback of the full 100 percent of the $200.00 in duties it paid on the importation of the salt into the United States because that $200.00 is a lesser amount than the total amount of customs duties paid to Mexico on the exported meat.</P>

Eligibility for full drawback of the $10.00 in U.S. duties under § 181.45(b) would be precluded because Product X, although unused, was not exported to Canada in the same condition as when imported into the United States within the meaning of § 181.45(b)(1).</P>

            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Drawback on goods entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico.</E> After goods in a duty-deferral program in the United States which have been sent from the United States and entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico are then withdrawn from that Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program either for entry into Canada or Mexico or for export to a non-NAFTA country, the person who filed the Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, (see paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section) may file a claim for drawback if the goods are withdrawn within 5 years from the date of the original importation of the good into the United States.

              <P>Company A imports glassware under subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS. The glassware is from France and would be dutiable under a regular consumption entry at $6,000. Company A alters the glassware by etching hotel logos on the glassware. Two weeks later, Company A sells the glassware <PRTPAGE P="406"/>to Company B, a Mexican company, and ships the glassware to Mexico. Company B enters the glassware and is assessed duties in an amount equivalent to US$6,200 and claims NAFTA preferential tariff treatment. Company B provides a copy of the Mexican landing certificate to Company A showing that the US$6,200 equivalent in duties was assessed but not yet paid to Mexico. If Mexico ultimately denies Company B's NAFTA claim and the Mexican duty payment becomes final, Company A, upon submission to Customs of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, is entitled to a waiver of the full $6,000 in U.S. duty.</P>

Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Mexico, whether or not pursuant to a warranty, and goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada pursuant to a warranty, are eligible for duty-free treatment, provided that the requirements of this section are met. Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty are subject to duty upon the value of the repairs or alterations using the applicable duty rate under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (see § 10.301 of this chapter), provided that the requirements of this section are met. For purposes of this section, “repairs or alterations” means restoration, addition, renovation, redyeing, cleaning, resterilizing, or other treatment which does not destroy the essential characteristics of, or create a new or commercially different good from, the good exported from the United States.

            <P>(2) May include verification of the applicable rate of duty applied to an originating good in accordance with Annex 302.2 of the NAFTA and may include a determination of whether a good is a qualifying good for purposes of Annex 703.2 of the NAFTA; and</P>
            <P>(3) Shall be conducted only by means of one or more of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A verification letter which requests information from a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer, including a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, and which identifies the good or material that is the subject of the verification.

If such an inquiry or request involves requesting the importer to obtain and provide written information from the exporter or producer of the good or from the producer of a material that is used in the production of the good, such information shall be requested by the importer and provided to the importer by the exporter or producer only on a voluntary basis, and a failure or refusal on the part of the importer to obtain and provide such information shall not be considered a failure of the exporter or producer to provide the information and shall not constitute a ground for denying preferential tariff treatment on the good.<PRTPAGE P="410"/>

            <P>(1) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt, to the address of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited;</P>
            <P>(2) To the customs administration of the country in which the visit is to occur; and</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Written consent required.</E> Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico pursuant to § 181.72(a)(3)(iii) of this part, CBP shall obtain the written consent of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of the good or producer of the material whose premises are to be visited.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Written consent procedures.</E> The written consent provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be delivered by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that generates a reliable receipt, to the CBP officer who gave the notification provided for in § 181.73 of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to provide written consent or to cooperate or to maintain records.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, where a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of a good, or a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, has not given its written consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 calendar days of receipt of notification pursuant to § 181.73 of this part, CBP may deny preferential tariff treatment to that good, or for purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good may consider as non-originating that material, that would have been the subject of the visit, provided that, as regards the good, notice of intent to deny such treatment is given to that exporter or producer of the good and to the U.S. importer thereof prior to taking such action. A failure on the part of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of a good, or on the part of the Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, to maintain records or provide access to such records or otherwise cooperate during the verification visit shall mean that the verification visit never took place and may be treated by CBP in the same manner as <PRTPAGE P="412"/>a failure to give written consent to a verification visit. However, in the case of a Canadian or Mexican producer of a good who is found during a verification visit to have not maintained records in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the producer's country, CBP may deny preferential tariff treatment on the good based solely on a failure to so maintain those records only if the producer does not conform the records to those Principles within 60 calendar days after CBP informs the producer in writing of that failure.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Postponement of visit in Canada or Mexico.</E> Following receipt of the notification provided for in § 181.73 of this part, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the date of such receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to the CBP officer who issued the notification of the verification visit, unless a longer period is requested and agreed to by CBP. Such a postponement shall not constitute a failure to provide written consent within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section and shall not otherwise by itself constitute a valid basis upon which CBP may:</P>
            <P>(1) Consider a material that is used in the production of a good to be a non-originating material; or</P>
            <P>(2) Deny preferential tariff treatment to a good.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Verification visits within the United States</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notification and consent procedure.</E> When the Canadian or Mexican customs administration intends to conduct a verification visit in the United States, notification of such intent will be given, and consent will be required, as provided for under Article 506 of the NAFTA. For purposes of the required notification to CBP, such notification shall be sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of International Trade, Commercial Targeting and Enforcement, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20229.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Postponement of visit.</E> Following receipt of notification from the Canadian or Mexican customs administration of its intention to conduct a verification visit in the United States, CBP may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the date of such receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Designation of observers.</E> A U.S. exporter or producer, including a producer of a material, whose good or material is the subject of a verification visit by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration shall be allowed to designate two observers to be present during the visit, subject to the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) The U.S. exporter or producer shall not be required to designate observers;</P>
            <P>(ii) There shall be no restriction on the class of persons that may be designated as observers by the U.S. exporter or producer;</P>
            <P>(iii) The observers to be present are designated in the written consent to the proposed visit or subsequent thereto;</P>
            <P>(iv) The observers do not participate in the verification visit in a manner other than as passive observers;</P>
            <P>(v) The presence of observers shall in no way affect the right to have legal counsel or other advisors present during the visit;</P>
            <P>(vi) There shall be no obligation on the part of the United States government or on the part of the Canadian or Mexican government to designate observers from its staff, even when the U.S. exporter or producer fails to, or specifically declines to, designate observers; and</P>
            <P>(vii) The failure of the U.S. exporter or producer to designate observers shall not result in the postponement of the visit.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except in the case of a pattern of conduct within the meaning of § 181.76(c) of this part, following receipt and analysis of the results of an origin verification initiated under <PRTPAGE P="413"/>§ 181.72(a) of this part in regard to a good imported into the United States and prior to denying preferential tariff treatment on the import transaction which gave rise to the origin verification, Customs shall provide the exporter or producer whose good is the subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the written origin determination shall be sent within 60 calendar days after conclusion of the origin verification process, unless circumstances require additional time, and shall set forth:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of the good that was the subject of the verification together with the identifying numbers and dates of the export and import documents pertaining to the good;</P>
            <P>(2) Subject to the provisions of § 181.131 of this part and except in the case of a negative origin determination where specific findings of fact cannot be made because of a failure to respond to a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire sent under § 181.72 of this part, a statement setting forth the findings of fact made in connection with the verification and upon which the determination is based; and</P>
            <P>(3) With specific reference to the rules applicable to originating goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, the legal basis for the determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Negative origin determinations.</E> If Customs determines, as a result of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part, that the good which is the subject of the verification does not qualify as an originating good, the written determination required under paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) Shall be sent by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer, if so requested by the customs administration of Canada or Mexico from which the good was exported; and</P>
            <P>(2) Shall, in addition to the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section, set forth the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A notice of intent to deny preferential tariff treatment on the good which is the subject of the determination;</P>
            <P>(ii) The specific date after which preferential tariff treatment will be denied, as established in accordance with § 181.76(a)(1) of this part;</P>
            <P>(iii) The period, established in accordance with § 181.76(a)(1) of this part, during which the exporter or producer of the good may provide written comments or additional information regarding the determination; and</P>
            <P>(iv) A statement advising the exporter or producer of the right to file a protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 and part 174 of this chapter:</P>
            <P>(A) Within 90 days after notice of liquidation is provided pursuant to part 159 of this chapter; or</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this section, an origin determination may be applied upon issuance of the determination under § 181.75 of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Negative origin determinations.</E> In the case of a negative origin determination issued under § 181.75(b) of this part:</P>
            <P>(1) The date on which preferential tariff treatment may be denied shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days from the date on which:</P>
            <P>(i) Receipt of the written determination by the exporter or producer is confirmed, if a request under § 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The written determination is sent by Customs, if no request under § 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; and</P>
            <P>(2) Before denying preferential tariff treatment, Customs shall take into account any comments or additional information provided by the exporter or producer during the period established in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Cases involving a pattern of conduct.</E> Where multiple origin verifications initiated under § 181.72(a) <PRTPAGE P="414"/>of this part indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer involving false or unsupported representations on Certificates of Origin that a good imported into the United States qualifies as an originating good, Customs may deny subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment on identical goods exported or produced by such person until that person establishes compliance with the rules applicable to originating goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part, provided that advance written notice of the intent to deny such claims is given to the importer. For purposes of this paragraph, a “pattern of conduct” means repeated instances of false or unsupported representations by an exporter or producer as established by Customs on the basis of not fewer than two origin verifications of two or more importations of the good that result in the issuance of not fewer than two written determinations issued to that exporter or producer pursuant to § 181.75 of this part which conclude, as a finding of fact, that Certificates of Origin completed and signed by that exporter or producer with respect to identical goods contain false or unsupported representations.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Differing determinations.</E> Where Customs determines, either as a result of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part or under any other circumstance, that a certain good imported into the United States does not qualify as an originating good based on a tariff classification or a value applied in the United States to one or more materials used in the production of the good, including a material used in the production of another material that is used in the production of the good, which differs from the tariff classification or value applied to the materials by the country from which the good was exported, the Customs determination shall not become effective until Customs provides written notification thereof both to the U.S. importer of the good and to the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Applicability of a determination to prior importations.</E> Customs shall not apply a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section to an importation made before the effective date of the determination if, prior to notification of the determination, the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported either issued an advance ruling under Article 509 of the NAFTA or any other ruling on the tariff classification or on the value of such materials, or gave consistent treatment to the entry of the materials under the tariff classification or value at issue, on which a person is entitled to rely and on which that person did in fact rely. For purposes of this paragraph, the person who received notification of the determination shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customs, in writing within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notification, that the conditions set forth herein have been met. For purposes of this paragraph:</P>
            <P>(1) A “ruling” on which a person is entitled to rely in the case of Canada must be issued pursuant to section 43.1(1) of the Customs Act (Advance Rulings) or in accordance with Departmental Memorandum 11-11-1 (National Customs Rulings) and in the case of Mexico must be issued pursuant to Article 34 of the Codigo Fiscal de la Federacion and pursuant to Article 30 of the Ley Aduanera or the applicable provision of Mexican law related to advance rulings under Article 509 of the NAFTA; and</P>
            <P>(2) “Consistent treatment” means the established application by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration that can be substantiated by the continued acceptance by the customs administration of the tariff classification or value of identical materials on importations of the materials into Canada or Mexico by the same importer over a period of not less than two years immediately prior to the date of signature of the Certificate of Origin for the good that is the subject of the determination referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, provided that with regard to those importations:</P>

            <P>(i) The tariff classification or value of the materials was not the subject of a verification, review or appeal by that customs administration on the date of <PRTPAGE P="415"/>the determination under paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The materials had not been accorded a different tariff classification or value by one or more district, regional or local offices of that customs administration on the date of the determination under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Detrimental reliance.</E> If Customs proposes to deny preferential tariff treatment to a good pursuant to a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section, Customs shall postpone the application of the determination for a period not exceeding 90 calendar days from the date of issuance of the determination where the U.S. importer of the good, or the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based, demonstrates to the satisfaction of Customs that it has relied in good faith to its detriment on the tariff classification or value applied to such materials by the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported.</P>

            <P>This subpart sets forth the rules which govern the issuance and application of advance rulings under Article 509 of the NAFTA and the procedures which apply for purposes of review of advance rulings under Article 510 of the NAFTA. Importers in the United States and exporters and producers located in Canada or Mexico may request and obtain an advance ruling on a NAFTA transaction only in accordance with the provisions of this subpart whenever the requested ruling involves a subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6) of this part. Accordingly, the provisions of this subpart shall apply in lieu of the administrative ruling provisions contained in subpart A of part 177 of this chapter except where the request for a ruling involves a subject matter not specified in § 181.92(b)(6).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions and general NAFTA advance ruling practice.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this subpart:</P>
            <P>(1) An <E T="03">advance ruling</E> is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by such other office as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that interprets and applies the provisions of NAFTA to a specific set of facts involving any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6) of this part. An “advance ruling letter” is an advance ruling issued in response to a written request and set forth in a letter addressed to the person making the request or his designee. A “published advance ruling” is an advance ruling <PRTPAGE P="417"/>which has been published in full text in the Customs Bulletin.</P>
            <P>(2) An <E T="03">authorized agent</E> is a person expressly authorized by a principal to act on his or her behalf. An advance ruling requested by an attorney or other person acting as an agent must include a statement describing the authority under which the request is made. With the exception of attorneys whose authority to represent is known, any person appearing before Customs as an agent in connection with an advance ruling request may be required to present evidence of his or her authority to represent the principal. The foregoing requirements will not apply to an individual representing his or her full-time employer or to a bona-fide officer, director or other qualified representative of a corporation, association, or organized group.</P>
            <P>(3) The term <E T="03">Headquarters Office,</E> means the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade at Headquarters, U. S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC.</P>
            <P>(4) An <E T="03">information letter</E> is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by such other office as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that does no more than call attention to a well-established interpretation of principles under the NAFTA, without applying it to a specific set of facts. If Customs believes that general information may be of some benefit to the person making the request, an information letter may be issued in response to a request for an advance ruling when:</P>
            <P>(i) The request suggests that general information, rather than an advance ruling, is actually being sought;</P>
            <P>(ii) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in this subpart; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The requested advance ruling cannot be issued for any other reason.</P>
            <P>(5) A <E T="03">NAFTA transaction</E> is an act or activity to which the NAFTA provisions apply. A “prospective” NAFTA transaction is one that is merely contemplated or is currently being undertaken but has not resulted in any arrival or in the filing of any entry or entry summary or other document or in any other act so as to bring the transaction, or any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs office. A “current” NAFTA transaction is one which is presently under consideration by a field office of Customs. A “completed” NAFTA transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs field office and with respect to which that office has issued a determination which is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to appeal, petition, protest or other review as provided in the applicable Customs laws and regulations. An “ongoing” NAFTA transaction is a series of identical, recurring transactions, consisting of current and completed transactions where future transactions are contemplated.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">General advance ruling practice.</E> An advance ruling may be requested under the provisions of this subpart with respect to prospective NAFTA transactions. An advance ruling will be based on the facts and circumstances presented by the requester.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Prospective NAFTA transactions.</E> It is in the interest of the sound administration of the NAFTA that persons engaging in any transaction affected by NAFTA fully understand the consequences of that transaction prior to its consummation. For this reason, Customs will give full and careful consideration to written requests from importers in the United States and exporters or producers in Canada or Mexico for advance rulings or information setting forth, with respect to a specifically described transaction, a definitive interpretation of applicable law or other appropriate information.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Current or ongoing NAFTA transactions.</E> A question arising in connection with a NAFTA transaction already before a Customs field office by reason of arrival, entry or otherwise will be resolved by that office in accordance with the principles and precedents previously announced by the Headquarters Office. If such a question cannot be resolved on the basis of clearly established rules set forth in <PRTPAGE P="418"/>the NAFTA or the regulations thereunder, or in applicable Treasury Decisions, rulings, opinions, or court decisions published in the Customs Bulletin, that field office may, if it believes it appropriate, forward the question to the Headquarters Office for consideration.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Completed NAFTA transactions.</E> A question arising in connection with an entry of merchandise which has been liquidated, or in connection with any other completed NAFTA transaction, may not be the subject of an advance ruling request under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Oral advice.</E> Customs will not issue an advance ruling in response to an oral request. Oral opinions or advice of Customs personnel are not binding on Customs. However, oral inquiries may be made to Customs offices regarding existing advance rulings, the scope of such advance rulings, the types of transactions with respect to which Customs will issue advance rulings, the scope of the advance rulings which may be issued, or the procedures to be followed in submitting advance ruling requests, as prescribed in this subpart.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Who may request an advance ruling.</E> An advance ruling may be requested by any of the following persons (individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, or other entities or groups) having a direct and demonstrable interest in the question or questions presented in the advance ruling request, or by the authorized agent of any such person:</P>
            <P>(i) An importer in the United States;</P>
            <P>(ii) An exporter or a producer of a good in Canada or Mexico; or</P>
            <P>(iii) A Canadian or Mexican producer of a material that is used in the production of a good imported into the United States, but only with regard to that material and only in regard to a matter described in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (v) and (vii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Subject matter of advance rulings.</E> Customs shall issue advance rulings under this subpart concerning the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Whether materials imported from a country other than the United States, Canada or Mexico and used in the production of a good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, as a result of production occurring entirely in the United States, Canada and/or Mexico;</P>
            <P>(ii) Whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under the transaction value method or under the net cost method as provided for in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part;</P>
            <P>(iii) For purposes of determining whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part, the appropriate basis or method for value to be applied by an exporter or a producer in Canada or Mexico, in accordance with the principles set forth in the appendix to this part, for calculating the transaction value of the good or of the materials used in the production of the good;</P>
            <P>(iv) For purposes of determining whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part, the appropriate basis or method for reasonably allocating costs, in accordance with the allocation methods set forth in the appendix to this part, for calculating the net cost of the good or the value of an intermediate material;</P>
            <P>(v) Whether a good qualifies as an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under the appendix to this part;</P>
            <P>(vi) Whether a good that re-enters the United States after having been exported from the United States to Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration qualifies for duty-free treatment in accordance with § 181.64 of this part;</P>
            <P>(vii) Whether the proposed or actual marking of a good satisfies country of origin marking requirements under part 134 of this chapter and under the Marking Rules set forth in part 102 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(viii) Whether an originating good qualifies as a good of Canada or Mexico under Annex 300-B, Annex 302.2 and Chapter Seven of the NAFTA; and</P>
            <P>(ix) Whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven of the NAFTA.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Submission of advance ruling requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Form.</E> A request for an advance ruling should be written in the English language and in the form of a letter. For any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6)(i), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), or (ix) of this part, the request may be directed either to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. (Mint Annex), Washington, DC 20229, or to the National Commodity Specialist Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, One Penn Plaza, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10119. For any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this part, the request must be directed to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. (Mint Annex), Washington, DC 20229.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Content</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Each request for an advance ruling must identify the specific subject matter under § 181.92(b)(6) of this part to which the request relates, must contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the NAFTA transaction and must state that the information presented is accurate and complete. The following facts must be included: the names, addresses, and other identifying information of all interested parties (if known); the name of the port or place at which any good involved in the transaction will be imported or which will otherwise have jurisdiction with respect to the act or activity described in the transaction; and a description of the transaction itself, appropriate in detail to the subject matter of the requested advance ruling. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the importer of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the exporter and, if known, producer of the good. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the exporter of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the producer and importer of the good, if known. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the producer of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the exporter and importer of the good, if known. In addition, where relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request for an advance ruling, and regardless of the specific nature of the advance ruling requested, the request must include:</P>
            <P>(i) A copy of any advance ruling or other ruling with respect to the tariff classification of the good that has been issued by CBP to the person submitting the request; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Sufficient information to enable CBP to classify the good where no advance ruling or other ruling with respect to the tariff classification of the good has been issued by CBP to the person submitting the request. Such information includes a full description of the good, including, where relevant, the composition of the good, a description of the process by which the good is manufactured, a description of the packaging in which the good is contained, the anticipated use of the good and its commercial, common or technical designation, and product literature, drawings, photographs or schematics.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Description of transaction</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The prospective Customs transaction to which the advance ruling request relates must be described in sufficient detail to permit proper application of the relevant NAFTA provisions.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tariff change rulings</E>—(A) <E T="03">General.</E> If the transaction involves the importation of a good or material for which a ruling is requested as to whether a change in tariff classification has occurred, the request should set forth: The principal or chief use of the good or material in the United States and the commercial, common, or technical designation of the good or material; if the good or material is composed of two or more substances, the relative quantity (by both weight and by volume) and value of each substance; any applicable special invoicing requirements set forth in part 141 of this chapter (if known); and any other information which may assist in determining <PRTPAGE P="420"/>the appropriate tariff classification of the good or material. The advance ruling request should also note, whenever germane, the purchase price of the good or material, and its approximate selling price in the United States. Each individual request for an advance ruling must be limited to five merchandise items, all of which must be of the same class or kind. Only NAFTA tariff change rulings will be issued under this subpart. Tariff classification rulings which do not involve the application of the NAFTA shall be issued under part 177 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Issues involving a change in tariff classification of a material.</E> Where the request for the advance ruling involves the application of a rule of origin that requires an assessment of whether materials used in the production of an imported good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, the request must list each material used in the production of the good and must:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Identify each material which is claimed to be an originating material and provide a complete description of each such material, including the basis for the claim as to originating status;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Identify each material which is a non-originating material, or for which the origin is unknown, and provide a complete description of each such material, including its tariff classification if known; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Describe all processing operations employed in the production of the good, the location of each operation and the sequence in which the operations occur.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">NAFTA rulings on regional value content.</E> NAFTA advance ruling requests, if involving the issue of whether a good satisfies a regional value content requirement under the transaction value method or under the net cost method, or under both methods, as provided for in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, must specify each method under which eligibility is sought. Where the transaction value method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: information sufficient to calculate the transaction value of the good in accordance with schedule II of the appendix to this part with respect to the transaction of the producer of the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used by the producer in the production of the good in accordance with the provisions of section 7 and, where applicable, section 6(10) of the appendix to this part; a complete description of each material that is claimed to be an originating material and that is used in the production of the good, including the basis for the claim as to originating status; information sufficient to permit an examination of the factors enumerated in schedule III or VIII of the appendix to this part where the advance ruling request involves an issue of whether, with respect to the good or material under the applicable schedule, the transaction value is acceptable; and information sufficient for any other circumstance to make any determination relevant to the application of the regional value content requirement to the good. Where the net cost method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: a list of all product, period and other costs relevant to determining the total cost of the good as defined in the appendix to this part; a list of all excluded costs to be subtracted from the total cost of the good as provided in the appendix to this part; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used in the production of the good, in accordance with section 7 of the appendix to this part; the basis for any allocation of costs in accordance with schedule VII of the appendix to this part; the period over which the net cost calculation is to be made; and any other information relevant to determining the appropriate value of any cost under this part. Where the advance ruling request concerns only the calculation of an element of a regional value content formula, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only contain the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), other than the information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii); the information in paragraph (b)(5); and any information in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) which is relevant <PRTPAGE P="421"/>to the issue that is the subject of the request.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">NAFTA rulings on producer materials. W</E> here the advance ruling request involves an issue with respect to an intermediate material under Article 402(10) of the NAFTA (see section 7(4) of the appendix to this part), the request must contain sufficient information to determine the origin and value of the material in accordance with Article 402(11) of the NAFTA (see section 7(6) of the appendix to this part). Where the advance ruling request is submitted by a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material under § 181.92(b)(5)(iii) of this part and concerns only the origin of such material, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only include the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), including any information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; any information in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; a sample as provided for in paragraph (b)(3) if relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; and the information in paragraph (b)(5).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Samples.</E> Each request for an advance ruling should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial representations of the good and, whenever possible, by a sample of the good unless a precise description of the good is not essential to the advance ruling requested. Any good consisting of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis, flow charts, CAS number, and related information. A sample submitted in connection with a request for an advance ruling becomes a part of the CBP file in the matter and will be retained until the advance ruling is issued or the advance ruling request is otherwise disposed of. A sample should only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other actions undertaken in connection with the advance ruling request.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Related documents.</E> If the question or questions presented in the advance ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any invoice, contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document must be submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be submitted inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the advance ruling request become a part of the CBP file in the matter and cannot be returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted, and an explanation of their bearing on the question or questions presented, must be expressly set forth in the advance ruling request.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Prior or current transactions—(i) General.</E> Each request for an advance ruling must state:</P>
            <P>(A) Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the same transaction or issue, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered by any CBP office;</P>
            <P>(B) Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the issue involved has ever been, or is currently, the subject of:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Review by the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom, or review by a judicial or quasi-judicial body in Canada or Mexico;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A verification of origin performed in the United States, Canada or Mexico;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) An administrative appeal in the United States, Canada or Mexico; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A request for an advance ruling under this subpart, or a request for an advance ruling in Canada or Mexico under an appropriate authority referred to in § 181.76(e)(1) of this part;</P>
            <P>(C) The status or disposition of any matter on which an affirmative statement is made under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(D) Whether the transaction described in the advance ruling request is but one of a series of similar and related transactions.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Change in status of transaction.</E> If a prospective transaction which is the <PRTPAGE P="422"/>subject of an advance ruling request becomes a current transaction, the person who submitted the request shall so notify the office processing the request.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Statement of position.</E> If the request for an advance ruling asks that a particular determination or conclusion be reached in the advance ruling letter, a statement must be included in the request setting forth the basis for that determination or conclusion, together with a citation of all relevant supporting authority.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Privileged or confidential information.</E> Information which is claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party) must be identified clearly, and the reasons such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party), must be set forth. An advance ruling will not be issued until all trade secret, privilege or confidentiality issues are resolved (see § 181.99(a)(3) of this part).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Signing; instruction as to reply.</E> The request for an advance ruling must be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as described in § 181.92(b)(5) of this part. An advance ruling requested by a principal or authorized agent may direct that the advance ruling letter be addressed to the other.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Requests for immediate consideration.</E> CBP will normally process requests for advance rulings in the order they are received and as expeditiously as possible, as specified in § 181.99 of this part. However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram or electronic transmission will be treated in the same manner as requests made by letter, but advance rulings will not be issued by telegram or electronic transmission. A telegram or electronic transmission must be followed up with a signed original within 14 calendar days of the submission of the telegram or electronic transmission. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular request for an advance ruling will be acted upon by the time requested.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A person submitting a request for an advance ruling and desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved should indicate that desire in writing at the time the advance ruling request is filed. <PRTPAGE P="423"/>Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the advance ruling request is under consideration, a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue or issues involved or when a determination or conclusion contrary to that advocated in the advance ruling request is contemplated. Conferences are scheduled for the purpose of affording the parties an opportunity to freely and openly discuss the matters set forth in the advance ruling request.

In particular, Customs must be advised when any transaction described in the advance ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office. In addition, any person engaged in a NAFTA transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office who has previously requested a NAFTA advance ruling with respect to that transaction must advise the field office of that fact.</P>

In addition, no NAFTA advance ruling letter will be issued with respect to any issue which is pending before the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">NAFTA advance ruling letters</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, Customs will, within 120 calendar days of receipt of a request, including any required information supplemental thereto, issue an advance ruling letter in the English language setting forth the position of Customs and the reasons therefor with respect to a specifically described Customs transaction whenever a request for such an advance ruling is submitted in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and it is in the sound administration of the NAFTA provisions to do so. Otherwise, a request for an advance ruling will be answered by an information letter or, in those situations in which general information is likely to be of little or no value, by a letter stating that no advance ruling can be issued. In the course of evaluating the advance ruling request Customs may solicit supplemental information from the person requesting the advance ruling. The submission of supplemental information will extend the time for response. The time for response will also be extended if it is necessary to obtain information from other government agencies or in the form of a laboratory analysis.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submission of NAFTA advance ruling letters to field offices.</E> Any importer engaging in a NAFTA transaction with respect to which an advance ruling letter has been issued under this subpart either must ensure that a copy of the advance ruling letter is attached to the documents filed with the appropriate Customs office in connection with that transaction or must otherwise indicate with the information filed for that transaction that an advance ruling has been received. Any person receiving an advance ruling stating Customs determination must set forth such determination in the documents or information filed in connection with any subsequent entry of that merchandise; failure to do so may result in a rejection of the entry and the imposition of such penalties as may be appropriate. An advance ruling received after the filing of such documents or information must immediately be brought to the attention of the appropriate Customs field office.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Disclosure of NAFTA advance ruling letters.</E> No part of the advance ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information relating to the business transactions of private parties, shall be deemed to constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and part 103 of this chapter, or shall be deemed to be subject to the confidentiality principle set forth in § 181.121 of this part, unless, as provided in § 181.93(b)(7) of this part, the information claimed to be exempt from disclosure is clearly identified and a valid basis for nondisclosure is set forth. Before the issuance of the advance ruling letter, the person submitting the advance ruling request will be notified of any decision adverse to his request for nondisclosure and will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working days of the date of notification, be permitted to withdraw the advance ruling request. If in the opinion of Customs an impasse exists on the issue of confidentiality and the person who submitted the advance ruling request does not withdraw the request, Customs will decline to issue the advance ruling. All advance ruling letters issued by Customs will be available, upon written request, for inspection and copying by any person (with any portions determined to be exempt from disclosure deleted).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Penalties for misrepresented or omitted material facts or for noncompliance.</E> If Customs determines that an issued advance ruling was based on incorrect information, the person to whom the advance ruling was issued may be subject to appropriate penalties unless that <PRTPAGE P="425"/>person demonstrates that he used reasonable care and acted in good faith in presenting the facts and circumstances on which the advance ruling was based. In addition, Customs may apply such measures as the circumstances may warrant in a case where a person to whom an advance ruling was issued has failed to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of the advance ruling.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Other NAFTA advice and guidance.</E> The Headquarters Office may on its own initiative from time to time issue other external advice and guidance with respect to issues or transactions arising under the NAFTA which come to its attention. Such NAFTA advice and guidance, which represent the official position of Customs and which are likely to be of widespread interest and application, are published in the Customs Bulletin, as described in § 181.101 of this part. Nothing in this subpart shall preclude Customs from issuing advice and guidance to its field offices concerning the application of the NAFTA.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Effect of NAFTA advance ruling letters; modification and revocation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Effect of NAFTA advance ruling letters</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> An advance ruling letter issued by Customs under the provisions of this subpart represents the official position of Customs with respect to the particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs personnel in accordance with the provisions of this subpart until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the advance ruling set forth in the advance ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority in the disposition of transactions involving the same circumstances. An advance ruling letter is generally effective on the date it is issued or such later date as may be specified in the advance ruling and, commencing on its effective date, may be applied to entries for consumption and warehouse withdrawals for consumption which are unliquidated, or to other transactions with respect to which Customs has not taken final action on that date. See, however, paragraph (b) of this section (ruling letters which modify previous advance ruling letters) and § 181.101 of this part (advance ruling letters published in the Customs Bulletin).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Application of NAFTA rulings to transactions</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> Each NAFTA ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the information furnished in connection with the ruling request and incorporated in the ruling letter, either directly, by reference, or by implication, is accurate and complete in every material respect. The application of an advance ruling letter by a Customs field office to the transaction to which it is purported to relate is subject to the verification of the facts incorporated in the advance ruling letter, a comparison of the transaction described therein to the actual transaction, and the satisfaction of any conditions on which the advance ruling was based, and if the facts are materially different or a condition has not been satisfied, the treatment specified in the advance ruling will not be applied to the actual transaction. If, in the opinion of any Customs field office by whom the transaction is under consideration or review, the advance ruling letter should be modified or revoked, the findings and recommendations of that office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration, prior to any final disposition with respect to the transaction by that office. If the transaction described in the NAFTA advance ruling letter and the actual transaction are the same, and any and all conditions set forth in the advance ruling letter have been satisfied, the advance ruling will be applied to the transaction.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tariff change rulings.</E> Each advance ruling letter concerning whether a change in tariff classification has occurred will be applied only with respect to transactions involving either articles which are identical to the sample submitted with the advance ruling request and reflect the same processing or articles which conform to the description set forth in the advance ruling letter.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Regional value content rulings.</E> Each advance ruling letter concerning the application of a regional value content requirement will be applied only <PRTPAGE P="426"/>with respect to transactions involving the same merchandise and identical facts.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Reliance on NAFTA advance rulings by others.</E> An advance ruling letter is subject to modification or revocation without notice to any person other than the person to whom the letter was addressed. Accordingly, no other person may rely on the advance ruling letter or assume that the principles of that advance ruling will be applied in connection with any transaction other than the one described in the letter. However, any person eligible to request an advance ruling under § 181.92(b)(5) of this part may request information as to whether a previously-issued advance ruling letter has been modified or revoked by writing the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229, and either enclosing a copy of the advance ruling letter or furnishing other information sufficient to permit the advance ruling letter in question to be identified.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Modification or revocation of NAFTA advance ruling letters</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Any NAFTA advance ruling letter may be modified or revoked by Customs Headquarters in any of the following circumstances or for any of the following purposes, provided that written notice of the modification or revocation is given to the person to whom the advance ruling letter was addressed:</P>
            <P>(i) If the ruling letter reflects or is based on an error:</P>
            <P>(A) Of fact;</P>
            <P>(B) In the tariff classification of a good or material that is the subject of the ruling;</P>
            <P>(C) In the application of a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part;</P>
            <P>(D) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good qualifies as a good of Canada or Mexico under Annex 300-B, Annex 302.2 or Chapter Seven of the NAFTA;</P>
            <P>(E) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven of the NAFTA; or</P>
            <P>(F) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good qualifies for duty-free treatment under § 181.64 of this part when the good re-enters the United States after having been exported to Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration;</P>
            <P>(ii) If the ruling letter is not in accordance with an interpretation agreed on by the United States, Canada and Mexico regarding Chapter Three or Chapter Four of the NAFTA;</P>
            <P>(iii) If there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based;</P>
            <P>(iv) To conform to a modification of Chapter Three, Four, Five or Seven of the NAFTA, or of the Marking Rules, or of the regulations set forth in this part; or</P>
            <P>(v) To conform to a judicial decision or change in domestic law.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Application of modification or revocation of NAFTA advance ruling letters.</E> The modification or revocation of a NAFTA advance ruling letter will not be applied to entries or warehouse withdrawals for consumption which were made prior to the effective date of such modification or revocation, except where the person to whom the advance ruling was issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and conditions.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Effective dates.</E> Generally, a NAFTA letter modifying or revoking an earlier advance ruling will be effective on the date it is issued. However, Customs may, upon request or on its own initiative, delay the effective date of such a modification or revocation for a period of up to 90 calendar days from the date of issuance. Such a delay may be granted at the request of the party to whom the ruling letter was issued, provided such party can demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customs that it relied on the earlier advance ruling in good faith and to its detriment. The evidence of such reliance must cover the period from the date of the letter modifying or revoking the advance ruling back to the date of that advance ruling and must list all transactions claimed to be covered by the modified or revoked advance ruling by entry number (or other Customs assigned number), the quantity and value of merchandise covered by each such <PRTPAGE P="427"/>transaction (where applicable), the ports of entry, and the dates of final action by Customs. Such evidence must also include contracts, purchase orders, or other materials tending to establish that future transactions were arranged based on the earlier advance ruling. The request for delay must specifically identify the prior ruling on which reliance is claimed. All persons requesting a delay will be issued a separate letter setting forth the period, if any, of the delay to be provided. In appropriate circumstances, Customs may decide to make its decision, with respect to a delay, applicable to all persons, irrespective of demonstrated reliance; in this event, a notice announcing the delay will be published in the <E T="04">Customs Bulletin</E> and individual ruling letters will not be issued.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative review</E>—(1) <E T="03">Submission of request for review.</E> Any person who received an advance ruling issued under this subpart, or an authorized agent of such person, may request administrative review, at CBP Headquarters, of that advance ruling, including any modification or revocation thereof, by letter addressed to the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. Such request shall be filed within 30 calendar days after issuance of the advance ruling and shall set forth the following information:</P>

            <P>(ii) The Customs identification number or employer identification number in the case of a U.S. importer and authorized agent thereof, the employer number or importer/exporter number assigned by Revenue Canada in the case of a Canadian exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof, and the federal taxpayer registry number (RFC) in the case of a Mexican exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof;</P>
            <P>(iii) The number and date of the advance ruling at issue;</P>

            <P>(vi) Whether an oral discussion of the issues, as provided in § 181.95 of this part, is desired.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Issuance of review decision.</E> Customs will normally issue a written decision within 120 days of receipt of the request for administrative review submitted under this section. However, Customs will, upon a reasonable showing of business necessity, issue a written decision within 60 days of receipt of the request for administrative review. For purposes of this paragraph, the date of receipt of the request for administrative review shall be the date on which all information necessary to process the request, including any information provided after submission of the request in connection with a conference, is filed with Customs.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> Any person whose claims with regard to a request for administrative review of an advance ruling have been denied in whole or in part under this section may seek judicial review by filing a civil action in the United States Court of International Trade in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 2632 within 180 days after the date of mailing of notice of the denial.</P>

            <P>This subpart sets forth the circumstances and procedures under <PRTPAGE P="428"/>which exporters and producers of merchandise imported into the United States may obtain information about, and administrative and judicial review of, an adverse marking decision, as provided for in Article 510 of the NAFTA. This subpart does not apply to the review of advance rulings issued under Article 509 of the NAFTA (see subpart I of this part) or to the review of determinations that a good is not an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part (see part 174 of this chapter).</P>

            <P>For purposes of this subpart, the following words and phrases have the meanings indicated:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Adverse marking decision</E> means a decision made by the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, which an exporter or producer of merchandise believes to be contrary to the provisions of Annex 311 of the NAFTA and which may be protested by the importer pursuant to § 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter. Notification of an adverse marking decision is given to an importer in the form of a CBP Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent, (Notice to Mark and/or Notice to Redeliver) and/or by assessing marking duties on improperly marked merchandise. Examples of adverse marking decisions include determinations by the port director or Center director before December 20, 2016, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017: That an imported article is not a good of a NAFTA country, as determined under the Marking Rules, and that it therefore cannot be marked “Canada” or “Mexico”; that a good of a NAFTA country is not marked in a manner which is sufficiently permanent; and that a good of a NAFTA country does not qualify for an exception from marking specified in Annex 311 of the NAFTA. Adverse marking decisions do not include: Decisions issued in response to requests for advance rulings under subpart I of this part or for internal advice under part 177 of this chapter; decisions on protests under part 174 of this chapter; and determinations that an article does not qualify as an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part.</P>
            <P>(b) An <E T="03">exporter</E> of merchandise is an exporter located in Canada or Mexico who must maintain records in that country relating to the transaction to which the adverse marking decision relates. The records must be sufficient to enable Customs to evaluate the merits of the exporter's claim(s) regarding the adverse marking decision.</P>
            <P>(c) A <E T="03">producer</E> of merchandise is a person who grows, mines, harvests, fishes, traps, hunts, manufactures, processes or assembles such merchandise in Canada or Mexico.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditional right to intervene.</E> An exporter or producer of merchandise does not have an independent right to protest an adverse marking decision. However, if an importer protests the adverse marking decision in accordance with section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter, the exporter or producer of the merchandise which is the subject of the adverse marking decision may intervene in the importer's protest. Such intervention shall not affect any time limits applicable to the protest or delay action on the protest.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Form and filing of intervention.</E> In order to intervene in an importer's protest, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the exporter or producer of the merchandise shall file, in triplicate, a typewritten statement of intervention, in English, with the Center director. The statement should be on letterhead paper in the form of a letter and should be clearly designated “NAFTA Exporter or Producer Intervention in Protest”. The statement shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his authorized agent. The provisions of § 174.3 of this chapter shall apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Content.</E> The NAFTA Exporter or Producer Intervention in Protest letter shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and address of the exporter or producer of the merchandise and the name and address of any authorized agent filing the request on behalf of such principal;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a Canadian exporter or producer, the employer number assigned by Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise; in the case of a Mexican exporter or producer, the Federal taxpayer registry number (RFC); and the Customs identification number of an authorized agent filing the request on behalf of such principal;</P>

            <P>(6) A detailed statement of position regarding why the exporter or producer <PRTPAGE P="430"/>believes the adverse marking decision is contrary to the provision of Annex 311 of the NAFTA;</P>
            <P>(7) A statement as to whether a Request for Basis of Adverse Marking Decision was filed under § 181.113 of this part, and if so, the date of such Request and of any Customs response thereto issued under § 181.114 of this part. Copies of the Request and the Customs response shall be submitted, if available;</P>
            <P>(8) The number assigned to the importer's protest;</P>
            <P>(9) A statement that the intervenor is the exporter or producer of the merchandise that was the subject of the adverse marking decision being protested by the importer and, if the intervenor is the exporter, a statement that it maintains sufficient records to enable Customs to evaluate the merits of its claim(s) regarding the adverse marking decision; and</P>
            <P>(10) If the intervenor prefers that the principle of confidentiality set forth in § 181.121 of this part be applied to the information submitted under this section, a statement to that effect. If no such statement is included in the letter, the intervention and information submitted in connection therewith shall be subject to the same treatment as that provided in the case of requests by all interested parties for consolidation of protests as set forth in § 174.15(b)(1) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of Intervention.</E> The rights of the intervenor under this section are subordinate to the importer's protest rights. Accordingly, intervention by an exporter or producer of merchandise will not affect the procedures under part 174 of this chapter, and the importer's elections concerning accelerated disposition and application for further review of the protest will govern how the protest is handled and how the intervention is considered. If the importer withdraws or settles the protest, the exporter or producer has no right to continue the intervention action.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Action by Center director.</E> If final administrative action has already been taken with respect to the importer's protest at the time the intervention is filed, the Center director shall so advise the exporter or producer and, if the importer has filed a civil action in the Court of International Trade as a result of a denial of the protest, the Center director shall advise the exporter or producer of that filing and of the exporter's or producer's right to seek to intervene in such judicial proceeding. If final administrative action has not been taken on the protest, the Center director shall forward the intervention letter to the Customs office which has the importer's protest under review for consideration in connection with the protest.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Final disposition.</E> The intervenor shall be notified in writing of the final disposition of the protest. If the protest is denied in whole or in part, the intervenor shall be furnished a copy of the notice given to the importer under § 174.29.</P>

            <P>Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of copper anodes provided for in heading 7402. The rule set out in Schedule I for heading 7402 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. There is no applicable regional value-content requirement for this heading. Therefore, in order for the copper anode to qualify as an originating good under the rule set out in Schedule I, Producer A may not use in the production of the copper anode any non-originating material provided for in Chapter 74.</P>
            <P>All of the materials used in the production of the copper anode are originating materials, with the exception of a small amount of copper scrap provided for in heading 7404, that is in the same chapter as the copper anode.

              <E T="03">Example 2:</E> section 5(2)</FP>
            <P>Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of ceiling fans provided for in subheading 8414.51. There are two alternative rules set out in Schedule I for subheading 8414.51, one of which specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading. The other rule specifies both a change in tariff classification from the subheading under which parts of the ceiling fans are classified and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, in order for the ceiling fan to qualify as an originating good under the first of the alternative rules, all of the materials that are classified under the subheading for parts of ceiling fans and used in the production of the completed ceiling fan must be originating materials.</P>

            <P>In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the ceiling fan satisfy the change in tariff classification set out in the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading, with the exception of one non-originating <PRTPAGE P="444"/>material that is classified under the subheading for parts of ceiling fans. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-originating material that does not satisfy the change in tariff classification specified in the first rule does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the ceiling fan or the total cost of the ceiling fan, whichever is applicable, the ceiling fan would be considered an originating good. Therefore, under section 5(2), the ceiling fan would not be required to satisfy the alternative rule that specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement.</P>

            <P>Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of plastic bags provided for in subheading 3923.29. The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other heading, except from subheadings 3920.20 or 3920.71, under which certain plastic materials are classified, and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the plastic bag to qualify as an originating good, any plastic materials that are classified under subheading 3920.20 or 3920.71 and that are used in the production of the plastic bag must be originating materials.</P>
            <P>In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the plastic bag satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, with the exception of a small amount of plastic materials classified under subheading 3920.71. Section 5(1) provides that the plastic bag can be considered an originating good if the value of the non-originating plastic materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the plastic bag or the total cost of the plastic bag, whichever is applicable. In this case, the value of those non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed the seven percent limit.</P>
            <P>However, the rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, under section 5(1)(c), in order to be considered an originating good, the plastic bag must also, except as otherwise provided in section 5(5), satisfy the regional value-content requirement specified in that rule. As provided in section 5(1)(c), the value of the non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, together with the value of all other non-originating materials used in the production of the plastic bag, will be taken into account in calculating the regional value content of the plastic bag.</P>

            <P>With the exception of a small amount of materials provided for in Chapter 39, all of the materials used in the production of the shoes are originating materials.</P>
            <P>Under section 5(5), if the value of all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the shoes does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the shoes or the total cost of the shoes, whichever is applicable, the shoes are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement specified in the rule set out in Schedule I in order to be considered originating goods.</P>

All of the materials used in the production of these chairs are originating materials, with the exception of a small quantity of non-originating materials that are classified as parts of barbers' chairs. These parts undergo no change in tariff classification because subheading 9402.10 provides for both barbers' chairs and their parts.</P>
            <P>Although Producer A's barbers' chairs do not qualify as originating goods under the rule set out in Schedule I, section 4(4)(b) provides, among other things, that, where there is no change in tariff classification from the non-originating materials to the goods because the subheading under which the goods are classified provides for both the goods and their parts, the goods shall qualify as originating goods if they satisfy a specified regional value-content requirement.</P>
            <P>However, under section 5(5), if the value of the non-originating materials does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the barbers' chairs or the total cost of the barbers' chairs, whichever is applicable, the barbers' chairs will be considered originating goods and are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement set out in section 4(4)(b)(v).</P>

This fine wool fabric, also produced by Producer A, is the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification under subheading 6204.41.</P>

            <P>The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 6204.41, under which the dress is classified, specifies both a change in tariff <PRTPAGE P="445"/>classification from any other chapter, except from those headings and chapters under which certain yarns and fabrics, including combed wool yarn and wool fabric, are classified, and a requirement that the good be cut and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries.</P>
            <P>Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the dress to qualify as an originating good, the combed wool yarn and the fine wool fabric made therefrom that are used by Producer A in the production of the dress must be originating materials.</P>
            <P>At one point Producer A uses a small quantity of non-originating combed wool yarn in the production of the fine wool fabric. Under section 5(6), if the total weight of the non-originating combed wool yarn does not exceed seven percent of the total weight of all the yarn used in the production of the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification, that is, the wool fabric, the dress would be considered an originating good.</P>

            <P>Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a NAFTA country. Material X is a non-originating material and is used in the production of Good A. Producer A provides Producer B, at no charge, with tools to be used in the production of Material X. The cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of Producer A has been <PRTPAGE P="451"/>expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VIII, the value of the tools is included in the value of Material X.

            <P>Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method and averages the calculation over the producer's fiscal year under section 6(15). Producer A determines that during that fiscal year Producer A incurred a gain on foreign currency conversion of $10,000 and a loss on foreign currency conversion of $8,000, resulting in a net gain of $2,000. Producer A also determines that $7,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $6,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A, and $3,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $2,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is not related to the production of Good A. The producer determines that the total cost of Good A is $45,000 before deducting the $1,000 net gain on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is therefore $44,000. That $1,000 net gain is not included in the value of non-originating materials under section 7(1).</P>

            <FP>
              <E T="03">Example 1:</E> section 7(2), Customs Value not Determined in a Manner Consistent with Schedule VIII</FP>

            <P>Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports material A into NAFTA country A. Producer A purchased material A from a middleman located in country B. The middleman purchased the material from a manufacturer located in country B. Under the laws in NAFTA country A that implement the <E T="03">Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,</E> the customs value of material A was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer. Producer A uses material A to produce Good C, and exports Good C to NAFTA country D. Good C is subject to a regional value-content requirement.</P>
            <P>Under section 4(1) of Schedule VIII, the price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. Section 1 of that Schedule defines producer and seller for purposes of the Schedule. A producer is the person who uses the material in the production of a good that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. A seller is the person who sells the material being valued to the producer.</P>
            <P>The customs value of material A was not determined in a manner consistent with Schedule VIII because it was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer, rather than on the price actually paid or payable by Producer A to the middleman. Thus, section 7(2) applies and material A is valued in accordance with Schedule VIII.</P>
            <FP>
              <E T="03">Example 2:</E> section 7(5), Value of Intermediate Materials</FP>
            <P>A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement under section 4(2)(b). The producer also produces Material A, which is used in the production of Good B. Both originating materials and non-originating materials are used in the production of Material A. Material A is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement under section 4(2)(a). The costs to produce Material A are the following:</P>

            <P>The producer designates Material A as an intermediate material and determines that, because all of the non-originating materials that are used in the production of Material A undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Schedule I, Material A would, under paragraph 4(2)(a) qualify as an originating material. The cost of the non-originating materials used in the production of Material A is therefore not included in the value of non-originating materials that are used in the production of Good B for the purpose of determining the regional value content of Good B. Because Material A has been designated as an intermediate material, the total cost of Material A, which is $10.60, is treated as the cost of originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of Good B.

            <P>Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, produces switches. In order for the switches to qualify as originating goods, Producer A designates subassemblies of the switches as intermediate materials. The subassemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. They satisfy that requirement, and qualify as originating materials. The switches are also subject to a regional value-content requirement, and, with the subassemblies designated as intermediate materials, are determined to have a regional value content of 65 percent.</P>
            <P>Producer A sells the switches to Producer B, located in NAFTA country B, who uses them to produce switch assemblies that are used in the production of Good B. The switch assemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producers A and B are not accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14. Producer B is therefore able, under section 7(4), to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials.</P>
            <P>If Producers A and B were accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14, Producer B would be unable to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials, because the production of both producers would be considered to be the production of one producer.</P>

            <P>Producer A uses Material X in the production of Material Y, which is also used in the production of Good B. Material Y is also subject to a regional value-content requirement. Under the proviso set out in section 7(4), Producer A cannot designate Material Y as an intermediate material, even if Material Y satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement, because Material X was already designated by Producer A as an intermediate material.</P>

            <P>Producer X uses the self-produced materials in the production of Good O, which is exported to NAFTA country Y. Materials A, B and C qualify as originating materials because they satisfy the applicable regional value-content requirements.</P>

The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a NAFTA country, and uses it in the production of Good A.

For purposes of determining the value of non-originating materials in order to calculate the regional value content of Material X, the tools are considered to be an originating material because they are an indirect material.

              <E T="03">Example 2:</E> section 14(1)</P>

            <P>Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports non-originating cotton, carded or combed, provided for in heading 5203 for use in the production of cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205. Because the change from cotton, carded or combed, to cotton yarn is a change within the same chapter, the cotton does not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 5205, which is a change from any other chapter, with certain exceptions. Therefore, the cotton yarn <PRTPAGE P="485"/>that Producer A produces from non-originating cotton is a non-originating good.</P>
            <P>Producer A then sells the non-originating cotton yarn to Producer B, also located in NAFTA country A, who uses the cotton yarn in the production of woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208. The change from non-originating cotton yarn to woven fabric of cotton is insufficient to satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 5208, which is a change from any heading outside headings 5208 through 5212, except from certain headings, under which various yarns, including cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205, are classified. Therefore, the woven fabric of cotton that Producer B produces from non-originating cotton yarn produced by Producer A is a non-originating good.</P>
            <P>However, under section 14(1), if Producer B chooses to accumulate the production of Producer A, the production of Producer A would be considered to have been performed by Producer B. The rule for heading 5208, under which the cotton fabric is classified, does not exclude a change from heading 5203, under which carded or combed cotton is classified. Therefore, under section 15(1), the change from carded or combed cotton provided for in heading 5203 to the woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208 would satisfy the applicable change of tariff classification for heading 5208. The woven fabric of cotton would be considered as an originating good.</P>
            <P>Producer B, in order to choose to accumulate Producer A's production, must have a statement described in section 14(4)(a)(ii).</P>

The methods the producer may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an illustration of this, a buyer provides the producer with a mold to be used in the production of the good and contracts with the producer to buy 10,000 units of that good. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 units arrives, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. In these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the mold over 4,000 unitsor 10,000 units but shall not choose to allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a single shipment of a good only where that single shipment comprises all of the units of the good acquired by the buyer under the contract or commitment for that <PRTPAGE P="490"/>number of units of the good between the producer and the buyer.</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (b) the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the good;</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (c) part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the good by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the producer, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or payable cannot be made in accordance with section 4(1)(d) of Schedule II; or</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (d) except as provided in section 3, the producer and the buyer are related persons and the relationship between them influenced the price actually paid or payable for the good.</FP>
            <FP>(3) The conditions or considerations referred to in subsection (2)(b) include the following circumstances:</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (a) the producer establishes the price actually paid or payable for the good on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in specified quantities;</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (b) the price actually paid or payable for the good is dependent on the price or prices at which the buyer sells other goods to the producer of the good; and</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (c) the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the good, such as where the good is a semi-finished good that has been provided by the producer to the buyer on condition that the producer will receive a specified quantity of the finished good from the buyer.</FP>
            <FP>(4) For purposes of subsection (2)(b), conditions or considerations relating to the production or marketing of the good shall not render the transaction value unacceptable, such as where the buyer undertakes on the buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the producer, activities relating to the marketing of the good.</FP>
            <FP>(5) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under section 4(1) of Schedule II, the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of section 2 of that Schedule. For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a liter of a particular good that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased good and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that good, such as when the purchased good is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the producer and the buyer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value of the good could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased good and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">SECTION 3.</HD>

            <FP>(1) In determining whether the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(2)(d), the fact that the producer and the buyer are related persons shall not in itself be grounds for the customs administration to render the transaction value unacceptable. In such cases, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship between the producer and the buyer did not influence the price actually <PRTPAGE P="491"/>paid or payable. Where the customs administration has reasonable grounds for considering that the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced the price, the customs administration shall communicate the grounds to the producer, and that producer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the grounds communicated by the customs administration. If that producer so requests, the customs administration shall communicate in writing the grounds on which it considers that the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced the price actually paid or payable.</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(2) Subsection (1) provides that, where the producer and the buyer are related persons, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the value provided that the relationship between the producer and the buyer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. It is not intended under subsection (1) that there should be an examination of the circumstances in all cases where the producer and the buyer are related persons. Such an examination will only be required where the customs administration has doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable because of the relationship between the producer and the buyer. Where the customs administration does not have doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable, it shall accept that price without requesting further information. For an illustration of this, the customs administration may have previously examined the relationship between the producer and the buyer, or it may already have detailed information concerning the relationship between the producer and the buyer, and may already be satisfied from that examination or information that the relationship between them did not influence the price actually paid or payable.</FP>
            <FP>(3) In applying subsection (1), where the producer and the buyer are related persons and the customs administration has doubts that the transaction value is acceptable without further inquiry, the customs administration shall give the producer an opportunity to supply such further information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. In such a case, the customs administration shall examine the relevant aspects of the sale, including the way in which the producer and the buyer organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price actually paid or payable for the good being valued was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced that price actually paid or payable. Where it can be shown that the producer and the buyer buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related persons, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between them. For an illustration of this, if the price actually paid or payable for the good had been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question or with the way in which the producer settles prices for sales to unrelated buyers, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the buyer and the producer. As another illustration, where it is shown that the price actually paid or payable for the good is adequate to ensure recovery of the total cost of producing the good plus a profit that is representative of the producer's overall profit realized over a representative period of time, such as on an annual basis, in sales of goods of the same class or kind, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the producer and the buyer.</FP>
            <FP>(4) In a sale between a producer and a buyer who are related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted and determined in accordance with section 2 of Schedule II wherever the producer demonstrates that the transaction value of the good in that sale closely approximates a test value referred to in subsection (5).</FP>
            <FP>(5) The value to be used as a test value shall be the transaction value of identical goods or similar goods sold at or about the same time as the good being valued is sold to an unrelated buyer who is located in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the buyer is located.</FP>
            <FP>(6) In applying a test value referred to in subsection (4), due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the value of the elements specified in section 4(1)(b) of Schedule II and the costs incurred by the producer in sales to unrelated buyers that are not incurred by the producer in sales to a related person.</FP>
            <FP>(7) The application of the test value referred to in subsection (4) shall be used at the initiative of the producer and shall be used only for comparison purposes to determine whether the transaction value of the good is acceptable. The test value shall not be used as the transaction value of that good.</FP>

            <FP>(8) Subsection (4) provides an opportunity for the producer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates a test value previously accepted by the customs administration, and is therefore acceptable under subsections (1) and (4). Where the application of a test value under subsection (4) demonstrates that the transaction value of the good being valued is acceptable, the customs administration shall not examine the question of influence in regard to the relationship between the producer and the buyer <PRTPAGE P="492"/>under subsection (1). Where the customs administration already has sufficient information available, without further inquiries, that the transaction value closely approximates a test value referred to in subsection (4), the producer is not required to apply a test value to demonstrate that the transaction value is acceptable under that subsection.</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(9) A number of factors must be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the transaction value of the identical goods or similar goods closely approximates the transaction value of the good being valued. These factors include the nature of the good, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the good is sold, and whether the difference in values is commercially significant. Since these factors may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply an acceptable standardized difference such as a fixed amount or fixed percentage difference in each case. For an illustration of this, a small difference in value in a case involving one type of good could be unacceptable, while a large difference in a case involving another type of good might be acceptable for the purposes of determining whether the transaction value closely approximates a test value set out in subsection (4).</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (b) the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the material;</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (c) part of the proceeds of any subsequent disposal or use of the material by the producer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or payable cannot be made in accordance with section 5(1)(d); and</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (d) except as provided in section 3, the producer and the seller are related persons and the relationship between them influenced the price actually paid or payable for the material.</FP>
            <FP>(4) The conditions or considerations referred to in subsection (3)(b) include the following circumstances:</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (a) the seller establishes the price actually paid or payable for the material on condition that the producer will also buy other materials or goods in specified quantities;</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (b) the price actually paid or payable for the material is dependent on the price or prices at which the producer sells other materials or goods to the seller of the material; and</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (c) the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the material, such as where the material is a semi-finished material that has been provided by the seller to the producer on condition that the seller will receive a specified quantity of the finished material from the producer.</FP>
            <FP>(5) For purposes of subsection (3)(b), conditions or considerations relating to the use of the material shall not render the transaction value unacceptable, such as where the producer undertakes on the producer's own account, even though by agreement with the seller, activities relating to the warranty of the material used in the production of a good.</FP>

            <FP>(6) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under section 5(1), the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of section 2(1). For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a liter of a particular good that is produced by using a material that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased material and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that material, such as when the purchased material is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the seller and the producer, it would be inappropriate to add the <PRTPAGE P="500"/>royalty and the transaction value of the material could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased material and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">SECTION 3.</HD>
            <FP>(1) In determining whether the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3)(d), the fact that the seller and the producer are related persons shall not in itself be grounds for the customs administration to render the transaction value unacceptable. In such cases, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship between the seller and the producer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. Where the customs administration has reasonable grounds for considering that the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced the price, the customs administration shall communicate the grounds to the producer, and that producer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the grounds communicated by the customs administration. If that producer so requests, the customs administration shall communicate in writing the grounds on which it considers that the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced the price actually paid or payable.</FP>
            <FP>(2) Subsection (1) provides that, where the seller and the producer are related persons, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the value provided that the relationship between the seller and the producer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. It is not intended under subsection (1) that there should be an examination of the circumstances in all cases where the seller and the producer are related persons. Such an examination will only be required where the customs administration has doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable because of the relationship between the seller and the producer. Where the customs administration does not have doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable, it shall accept that price without requesting further information. For an illustration of this, the customs administration may have previously examined the relationship between the seller and the producer, or it may already have detailed information concerning the relationship between the seller and the producer, and may already be satisfied from that examination or information that the relationship between them did not influence the price actually paid or payable.</FP>
            <FP>(3) In applying subsection (1), where the seller and the producer are related persons and the customs administration has doubts that the transaction value is acceptable without further inquiry, the customs administration shall give the producer an opportunity to supply such further information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. In such a case, the customs administration shall examine the relevant aspects of the sale, including the way in which the seller and the producer organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price actually paid or payable by that producer for the material being valued was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship between the seller and the producer influenced that price actually paid or payable. Where it can be shown that the seller and the producer buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related persons, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between them. For an illustration of this, if the price actually paid or payable for the material had been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question or with the way in which the seller settles prices for sales to unrelated buyers, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the producer and the seller. For another illustration of this, where it is shown that the price actually paid or payable for the material is adequate to ensure recovery of the total cost of producing the material plus a profit that is representative of the seller's overall profit realized over a representative period of time, such as on an annual basis, in sales of materials of the same class or kind, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the seller and the producer.</FP>
            <FP>(4) In a sale between a seller and a producer who are related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted and determined in accordance with section 2(1), wherever the seller or the producer demonstrates that the transaction value of the material in that sale closely approximates one of the following test values that occurs at or about the same time as the sale and is chosen by the seller or the producer:</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (a) the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 2(1);</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (b) the value of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 9; or</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (c) the value of identical materials or similar materials, as determined in accordance with section 10.<PRTPAGE P="501"/>
            </FP>
            <FP>(5) In applying a test value referred to in subsection (4), due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the value of the elements specified in section 5(1)(b) and the costs incurred by the seller in sales to unrelated buyers that are not incurred by the seller in sales by the seller to a related person.</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(6) The application of a test value referred to in subsection (4) shall be used at the initiative of the seller, or at the initiative of the producer with the consent of the seller, and shall be used only for comparison purposes to determine whether the transaction value of the material is acceptable. The test value shall not be used as the transaction value of that material.</FP>
            <FP>(7) Subsection (4) provides an opportunity for the seller or the producer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates a test value previously accepted by the customs administration of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, and is therefore acceptable under subsection (1). Where the application of a test value under subsection (4) demonstrates that the transaction value of the material being valued is acceptable, the customs administration shall not examine the question of influence in regard to the relationship between the seller and the producer under subsection (1). Where the customs administration already has sufficient information available, without further inquiries, that the transaction value closely approximates one of the test values determined under subsection (4), the seller or the producer is not required to apply a test value to demonstrate that the transaction value is acceptable under that subsection.</FP>
            <FP>(8) A number of factors must be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the transaction value of the identical materials or similar materials closely approximates the transaction value of the material being valued. These factors include the nature of the material, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the material is sold, and whether the difference in values is commercially significant. Since these factors may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply an acceptable standardized difference such as a fixed amount or fixed percentage difference in each case. For an illustration of this, a small difference in value in a case involving one type of material could be unacceptable, while a large difference in a case involving another type of material might be acceptable for the purposes of determining whether the transaction value closely approximates a test value set out in subsection (4).</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">SECTION 4.</HD>
            <FP>(1) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money: it may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly to the seller. For an illustration of this, the settlement by the producer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, is an indirect payment.</FP>
            <FP>(2) Activities undertaken by the producer on the producer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 5, shall not be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the activities might be regarded as being for the benefit of the seller.</FP>
            <FP>(3) The transaction value shall not include charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance related to the use of the material by the producer, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable.</FP>
            <FP>(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the producer to the seller that do not relate to the purchase of the material are not part of the transaction value.</FP>

            <FP>(12) The producer shall choose the method of allocating to the material the value of the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv), provided that the value is reasonably allocated to the material in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The methods the producer may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an illustration of this, a producer provides the seller with a mold to be used in the production of the material and contracts with the seller to buy 10,000 units of that material. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 units arrives, the seller has already produced 4,000 units. In these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but shall not choose to allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a single shipment of material only where that single shipment comprises all of the units of the material acquired by the producer under the contract or commitment for that number of units of the material between the seller and the producer.</FP>
            <FP>(13) The addition for the royalties referred to in subsection (1)(c) shall be the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of the producer, or where the payment for the royalties is recorded on the books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of that other person.</FP>
            <FP>(14) The value of the proceeds referred to in subsection (1)(d) shall be the amount that is recorded for such proceeds on the books of the producer or the seller.</FP>

            <FP>(1) If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be the transaction value of identical materials sold, at or about the same time as the material being valued was shipped to the producer, to a buyer located in the same country as the producer.</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of identical materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be used to determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is found, the transaction value of identical materials sold at a different commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.</FP>
            <FP>(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an adjustment is reasonable and accurate. For an illustration of this, a bona fide price list contains prices for different quantities. If the material being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical materials for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's bona fide price list and using the price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that sales had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a value under this section is not appropriate.</FP>
            <FP>(4) If more than one transaction value of identical materials is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the value of the material under this section.</FP>

            <FP>(2) In applying this section, the transaction value of similar materials in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity of materials as the material being valued shall be used to determine the value of the material. Where no such sale is found, the transaction value of similar materials sold at a different commercial level or in different quantities, adjusted to take into account the differences attributable to the commercial level or quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that the adjustment is reasonable and accurate, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.(3) A condition for adjustment under subsection (2) because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment be made only on the basis of evidence that clearly establishes that an adjustment is reasonable and accurate.

            <FP>(2) If neither identical materials nor similar materials are sold at or about the same time the material being valued is received by the producer, the value shall, subject to the deductions provided for under subsection (1), be based on the unit price at which identical materials or similar materials are sold in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, in the same condition as the material was in when received by the producer, at the earliest date within 90 days after the date the material being valued was received by the producer.</FP>
            <FP>(3) The expression “unit price at which those identical materials or similar materials are sold, in the greatest aggregate quantity” in subsection (1) means the price at which the greatest number of units is sold in sales between unrelated persons. For an illustration of this, materials are sold from a price list which grants favorable unit prices for purchases made in larger quantities.</FP>

Sales in the country in which the producer is located of the narrowest group or range of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, shall be examined. For the purposes of this section, “materials of the same class or kind” includes materials imported from the same country as the material being valued as well as materials imported from other countries or acquired within the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located.</FP>

            <FP>(2) For purposes of subsections (1)(a) and (b), where the costs recorded on the books of the producer of the material relate to the production of other goods and materials as well as to the production of the material being valued, the costs referred to in subsections (1)(a) and (b) with respect to the material being valued shall be those costs recorded on the books of the producer of the material that can be reasonably allocated to that material in accordance with Schedule VII.</FP>
            <FP>(3) The amount for profit and general expenses referred to in subsection (1)(c) shall be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material being valued unless the profit and general expenses figures that are supplied with that information are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales by producers of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued who are located in the country in which the material is produced or the producer is located, as the case may be. The information supplied shall be prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the country in which the material being valued is produced. Where the material is produced in the territory of a NAFTA country, the information shall be prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles set out in the authorities listed for that NAFTA country in Schedule XII.</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(4) For purposes of subsection (1)(c) and subsection (3), general expenses means the direct and indirect costs of producing and selling the material that are not included under subsections (1)(a) and (b).</FP>
            <FP>(5) For purposes of subsection (3), the amount for profit and general expenses shall be taken as a whole. Where, in the information supplied by or on behalf of the producer of a material, the profit figure is low and the general expenses figure is high, the profit and general expense figures taken together may nevertheless be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued. Where the producer of a material can demonstrate that it is taking a nil or low profit on its sales of the material because of particular commercial circumstances, its actual profit and general expense figures shall be taken into account, provided that the producer of the material has valid commercial reasons to justify them and its pricing policy reflects usual pricing policies in the branch of industry concerned. For an illustration of this, such a situation might occur where producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforeseeable drop in demand, or where the producers sell the material to complement a range of materials and goods being produced in the country in which the material is sold and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. A further illustration is where a material was being launched and the producer accepted a nil or low profit to offset high general expenses associated with the launch.</FP>
            <FP>(6) Where the figures for the profit and general expenses supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of materials of the same class or kind as the material being valued that are made by other producers in the country in which that material is sold, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based on relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material.</FP>
            <FP>(7) Where a customs administration uses information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the material for the purposes of determining the value of a material under this section, the customs administration shall communicate to the producer, if that producer so requests, the source of such information, the data used and the calculations based upon such data, subject to the provisions on confidentiality under Article 507 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country.</FP>
            <FP>(8) Whether certain materials are of the same class or kind as the material being valued shall be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved. For purposes of determining the amount for profit and general expenses usually reflected under the provisions of this section, sales of the narrowest group or range of materials of the same class or kind, which includes the material being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, shall be examined. For the purposes of this section, the materials of the same class or kind must be from the same country as the material being valued.</FP>

            <FP>(1) Where there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of the materials cannot be determined under sections 6 through 10, the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be determined under this section using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of this Schedule and on the basis of data available in the country in which the producer is located.</FP>
            <FP>(2) The value of the material determined under this section shall not be determined on the basis of</FP>

            <FP>(3) To the greatest extent possible, the value of the material determined under this section shall be based on the methods of valuation set out in sections 2 through 10, but a reasonable flexibility in the application of such methods would be in conformity with the aims and provisions of this section. For an illustration of this, under section 6, the requirement that the identical materials should be sold at or about the same time as the time the material being valued is shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted. Similarly, identical materials produced in a country other than the country in which the material is produced could be the basis for determining the value of the material, or the value of identical materials already determined under section 9 could be used. For another illustration, under section 7, the requirement that the similar materials should be sold at or about the same time as the material being valued are shipped to the producer could be flexibly interpreted. Likewise, similar materials produced in a country other than the country in which the material is produced could be the basis for determining the value of the material, or the value of similar materials already determined under the provisions of section 9 could be used. For a further illustration, under section 9, the ninety days requirement could be administered flexibly.</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (1) the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the first two years of the contract is 1.9 years;</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (2) the federal government debt obligations that are nearest in maturities to the weighted average principal maturity of the contract are 1- and 2-year maturities, and the yields on them are 3.0 and 3.5 percent, respectively; therefore, using linear interpolation, the yield on a federal government debt obligation that has a maturity equal to the weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule of the first two years of the contract is 3.45 percent. This amount is calculated as follows:</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP1-2"> 3.0 + [((3.5 − 3.0) × (1.9 − 1.0)) / (2.0 − 1.0)]</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP1-2"> = 3.45%</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1"> (3) the producer's contract interest rate, for the third and fourth years of the loan, of 8 percent is within 700 basis points of the 3.45 percent yield on federal government debt obligations that have maturities equal to the 1.9-year weighted average principal maturity of the payment schedule under the third and fourth years of the producer's loan contract; therefore, none of the producer's interest costs are considered to be non-allowable interest costs for purposes of the definition “non-allowable interest costs”.</FP>

            <SUBJECT>General manufacturing drawback ruling.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose; eligibility.</E> General manufacturing drawback rulings are designed to simplify drawback for certain common manufacturing operations but do not preclude or limit the use of applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings (see § 191.8). A manufacturer or producer engaged in an operation that falls within a published general manufacturing drawback ruling may submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under that general ruling. Where a separately-incorporated subsidiary of a parent corporation is engaged in manufacture or production for drawback, the subsidiary is the proper party to submit the letter of notification, and cannot operate under <PRTPAGE P="527"/>a letter of notification submitted by the parent corporation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Publication.</E> General manufacturing drawback rulings are contained in appendix A to this part. As deemed necessary by Customs, new general manufacturing drawback rulings will be issued as Treasury Decisions and added to the appendix thereafter.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submission</E>—(i) <E T="03">Where filed.</E> Letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling shall be submitted to any drawback office where drawback entries will be filed and liquidated, provided that the general manufacturing drawback ruling will be followed without variation. If there is any variation in the general manufacturing drawback ruling, the manufacturer or producer shall apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling under § 191.8 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Copies.</E> Letters of notification of intent shall be submitted in duplicate unless claims are to be filed at more than one drawback office, in which case one additional copy of the letter of notification shall be filed for each additional office. Upon issuance of a letter of acknowledgment (paragraph (c)(1) of this section), the drawback office with which the letter of notification is submitted shall forward the additional copy to such additional office(s), with a copy of the letter of acknowledgment.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Information required.</E> Each manufacturer or producer submitting a letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under this section must provide the following specific detailed information:</P>
            <P>(i) Name and address of manufacturer or producer (if the manufacturer or producer is a separately-incorporated subsidiary of a corporation, the subsidiary corporation must submit a letter of notification in its own name);</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of a business entity, the names of the persons listed in § 191.6(a)(1) through (6) who will sign drawback documents;</P>
            <P>(iii) Locations of the factories which will operate under the letter of notification;</P>
            <P>(iv) Identity (by T.D. number and title) of the general manufacturing drawback ruling under which the manufacturer or producer will operate;</P>

            <P>(vii) Basis of claim used for calculating drawback; and</P>
            <P>(viii) IRS (Internal Revenue Service) number (with suffix) of the manufacturer or producer.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Review and action by CBP.</E> The drawback office to which the letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling was submitted shall review the letter of notification of intent.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Acknowledgment.</E> The drawback office shall promptly issue a letter of acknowledgment, acknowledging receipt of the letter of intent and authorizing the person to operate under the identified general manufacturing drawback ruling, subject to the requirements and conditions of that general manufacturing drawback ruling and the law and regulations, to the person who submitted the letter of notification if:</P>
            <P>(i) The letter of notification is complete (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> containing the information required in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);</P>
            <P>(ii) The general manufacturing drawback ruling identified by the manufacturer or producer is applicable to the manufacturing or production process;</P>
            <P>(iii) The general manufacturing drawback ruling identified by the manufacturer or producer is followed without variation; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The described manufacturing or production process is a manufacture or production under § 191.2(q) of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer-generated number.</E> With the letter of acknowledgment the drawback office shall include the unique computer-generated number assigned to the acknowledgment of the letter of notification of intent to operate. This number must be stated when the person files manufacturing drawback claims with Customs under the <PRTPAGE P="528"/>general manufacturing drawback ruling.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-conforming letters of notification of intent.</E> If the letter of notification of intent to operate does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section in any respect, the drawback office shall promptly and in writing specifically advise the person of this fact and why this is so. A letter of notification of intent to operate which is not acknowledged may be resubmitted to the drawback office with which it was initially submitted with modifications and/or explanations addressing the reasons given for non-acknowledgment, or the matter may be referred (by letter from the manufacturer or producer) to CBP Headquarters (Attention: Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Duration.</E> Acknowledged letters of notification under this section shall remain in effect under the same terms as provided for in § 191.8(h) for specific manufacturing drawback rulings.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 191.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Agency.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An owner of the identified merchandise, the designated imported merchandise and/or the substituted other merchandise that is used to produce the exported articles may employ another person to do part, or all, of the manufacture or production under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b) and § 191.2(q) of this subpart. For purposes of this section, such owner is the principal and such other person is the agent. Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), the principal shall be treated as the manufacturer or producer of merchandise used in manufacture or production by the agent. The principal must be able to establish by its manufacturing records, the manufacturing records of its agent(s), or the manufacturing records of both (or all) parties, compliance with all requirements of this part (see, in particular, § 191.26 of this part).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Contract.</E> The manufacturer must establish that it is the principal in a contract between it and its agent who actually does the work on either the designated or substituted merchandise, or both, for the principal. The contract must include:</P>
            <P>(i) Terms of compensation to show that the relationship is an agency rather than a sale;</P>
            <P>(ii) How transfers of merchandise and articles will be recorded by the principal and its agent;</P>
            <P>(iii) The work to be performed on the merchandise by the agent for the principal;</P>
            <P>(iv) The degree of control that is to be exercised by the principal over the agent's performance of work;</P>
            <P>(v) The party who is to bear the risk of loss on the merchandise while it is in the agent's custody; and</P>
            <P>(vi) The period that the contract is in effect.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ownership of the merchandise by the principal.</E> The records of the principal and/or the agent must establish that the principal had legal and equitable title to the merchandise before receipt by the agent. The right of the agent to assert a lien on the merchandise for work performed does not derogate the principal's ownership interest under this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Sales prohibited.</E> The relationship between the principal and agent must not be that of a seller and buyer. If the parties' records show that, with respect to the merchandise that is the subject of the principal-agent contract, the merchandise is sold to the agent by the principal, or the articles manufactured by the agent are sold to the principal by the agent, those records are inadequate to establish existence of a principal-agency relationship under this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Specific manufacturing drawback rulings; general manufacturing drawback rulings</E>—(1) <E T="03">Owner.</E> An owner who intends to operate under the principal-agent procedures of this section must state that intent in any letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 191.7 of this subpart or in any application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 191.8 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Agent.</E> Each agent operating under this section must have filed a letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.7), for an agent, covering the articles manufactured or produced, or have obtained a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.8), as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certificate; Drawback entry; Certificate of manufacture and delivery</E>—(1) <E T="03">Contents of certificate; when filing not required.</E> Principals and agents operating <PRTPAGE P="531"/>under this section are not required to file a certificate of delivery (for the merchandise transferred from the principal to the agent) or a certificate of manufacture and delivery (for the articles transferred from the agent to the principal). The principal for whom processing is conducted under this section shall file, with any drawback claim or certificate of manufacture and delivery based on an article manufactured or produced under the principal-agent procedures in this section, a certificate, subject to the recordkeeping requirements of §§ 191.15 of this subpart and 191.26 of this part, certifying that upon request by Customs it can establish the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Quantity, kind and quality of merchandise transferred from the principal to the agent;</P>
            <P>(ii) Date of transfer of the merchandise from the principal to the agent;</P>
            <P>(iii) Date of manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;</P>
            <P>(iv) Total quantity and description of merchandise appearing in or used in manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;</P>
            <P>(v) Total quantity and description of articles produced in manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;</P>
            <P>(vi) Quantity, kind and quality of articles transferred from the agent to the principal; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Date of transfer of the articles from the agent to the principal.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Blanket certificate.</E> The certificate required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be a blanket certificate for a particular kind and quality of merchandise for a stated period.</P>

The party shall record this transfer by preparing and issuing in favor of such other party a certificate of delivery, certified by the importer or other party through whose possession the merchandise or manufactured article passed (see paragraph (c) of this section). A certificate of delivery issued with respect to the delivered merchandise or article:</P>
            <P>(1) Documents the transfer of that merchandise or article;</P>
            <P>(2) Identifies such merchandise or article as being that to which a potential right to drawback exists; and</P>

            <P>(12) If the merchandise transferred is substituted for the designated imported merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2), the HTSUS or Schedule B commodity number, with a minimum of 6 digits.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Intermediate transfer</E>—(1) <E T="03">Imported merchandise.</E> If the imported merchandise was not delivered directly from the importer to the manufacturer, or from the importer to the exporter (or destroyer), each intermediate transfer of the imported merchandise shall be documented by means of a certificate <PRTPAGE P="532"/>of delivery issued in favor of the receiving party, and certified by the person through whose possession the merchandise passed.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Manufactured article.</E> If the article manufactured or produced under 19 U.S.C. 1313 (a) or (b) is not delivered directly from the manufacturer to the exporter (or destroyer), each transfer after the transfer from the manufacturer (which shall be documented by means of a certificate of manufacture and delivery) shall be documented by means of a certificate of delivery, issued in favor of the receiving party, and certified by the person through whose possession the article passed.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Exchanged merchandise.</E> To comply with §§ 191.21 and 191.22 of this part, the use of domestic merchandise taken in exchange for imported merchandise of the same kind and quality (as defined in § 191.2(x)(1) of this part for purposes of 19 U.S.C. 1313(b)) shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the transfer of the imported merchandise. This provision shall be known as tradeoff and is authorized by § 313(k) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> Tradeoff must occur between two separate legal entities but it is not necessary that the entity exchanging the imported merchandise be the importer thereof. In addition, tradeoff must consist of an exchange of same kind and quality merchandise and nothing else (the exchange may be of different quantities of same kind and quality merchandise, but may not involve the payment or receipt of cash payments or other than same kind and quality merchandise). If the quantities of merchandise exchanged are different, the lesser quantity shall be the quantity available for drawback. If the quantity of domestic merchandise received is greater than the quantity of imported merchandise exchanged, the merchandise identified for drawback shall be the portion of the domestic merchandise equal to the quantity of imported merchandise which is first received.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Identification of merchandise or articles by accounting method.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section provides for the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes by the use of accounting methods. This section applies to identification of merchandise or articles in inventory or storage, as well as identification of merchandise used in manufacture or production (see § 191.2(h) of this subpart). This section is not applicable to situations in which the drawback law authorizes substitution (substitution is allowed in specified situations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), 1313(j)(2), 1313(k), and 1313(p); this section does apply to situations in these subsections in which substitution is not allowed, as well as to the subsections of the drawback law under which no substitution is allowed). When substitution is authorized, merchandise or articles may be substituted without reference to this section, under the criteria and conditions specifically authorized in the statutory and regulatory provisions providing for the substitution.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Conditions and criteria for identification by accounting method.</E> Manufacturers, producers, claimants, or other appropriate persons may identify for drawback purposes lots of merchandise or articles under this section, subject to each of the following conditions and criteria:</P>
            <P>(1) The lots of merchandise or articles to be so identified must be fungible (see § 191.2(o) of this part);</P>

            <P>(2) The person using the identification method must be able to establish that inventory records (for example, material control records), prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, account for the lots of merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory. Even if merchandise or articles are received or withdrawn <PRTPAGE P="534"/>at different geographical locations, if such inventory records treat receipts or withdrawals as being from the same inventory, those inventory records may be used to identify the merchandise or articles under this section, subject to the conditions of this section. If any such inventory records (that is, inventory records prepared and used in the ordinary course of business) treat receipts and withdrawals as being from different inventories, those inventory records must be used and receipts into or withdrawals from the different inventories may not be accounted for together. If units of merchandise or articles can be specifically identified (for example, by serial number), the merchandise or articles must be specifically identified and may not be identified by accounting method, unless it is established that inventory records, prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, treat the merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory (subject to the above conditions);</P>
            <P>(3) Unless otherwise provided in this section or specifically approved by Customs (by a binding ruling under part 177 of this chapter), all receipts (or inputs) into and all withdrawals from the inventory must be recorded in the accounting record;</P>
            <P>(4) The records which support any identification method under this section are subject to verification by Customs (see § 191.61 of this part). If Customs requests such verification, the person using the identification method must be able to demonstrate how, under generally accepted accounting procedures, the records which support the identification method used account for all merchandise or articles in, and all receipts into and withdrawals from, the inventory, and the drawback per unit for each receipt and withdrawal; and</P>
            <P>(5) Any accounting method which is used by a person for drawback purposes under this section must be used without variation with other methods for a period of at least one year, unless approval is given by Customs for a shorter period.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Approved accounting methods.</E> The following accounting methods are approved for use in the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes under this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">First-in, first-out (FIFO)</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The FIFO method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the first merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example.</E> If the beginning inventory is zero, 100 units with $1 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 2nd of the month, 50 units with no drawback attributable per unit are received into inventory on the 5th of the month, 75 units are withdrawn for domestic (non-export) shipment on the 10th of the month, 75 units with $2 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 15th of the month, 100 units are withdrawn for export on the 20th of the month, and no other receipts or withdrawals occurred in the month, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $75 (25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, 50 units from the receipt on the 5th with no drawback attributable per unit, and 25 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/<PRTPAGE P="535"/>unit, and 25 with $2 drawback unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $2 drawback/unit).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Last-in, first out (LIFO)</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The LIFO method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the last merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the newest (last-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example.</E> In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $175 (75 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit and 25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $0 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (all with $1 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (75 with $1 drawback/unit and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (75 with $2 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $1 drawback/unit).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Low-to-high</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The low-to-high method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles in inventory. Merchandise or articles with no drawback attributable to them (for example, domestic merchandise or duty-free merchandise) must be accounted for and are treated as having the lowest drawback attributable to them. Under this method, withdrawals are from the merchandise or articles with the least amount of drawback attributable to them, then those with the next higher amount, and so forth. If the same amount of drawback is attributable to more than one lot of merchandise or articles, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles among those lots with the same amount of drawback attributable. Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import more than 5 years (more than 3 years for unused merchandise drawback) before the claimed export, no drawback could be granted).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Ordinary</E>—(A) <E T="03">Method.</E> Under the ordinary low-to-high method, all receipts into and all withdrawals from the inventory are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal, whether for export or domestic shipment, is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles available in the inventory.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Example.</E> In this example, the beginning inventory is zero, and receipts into and withdrawals from the inventory are as follows:</P>

            <P>The drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt with the lowest drawback amount per unit is the January 2 receipt), the drawback attributable to the January 28 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no <PRTPAGE P="536"/>drawback) is zero (the remainder of the January 2 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $100.50 (the January 5 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 23 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is zero (the February 20 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $102.50 (the January 25 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the March 21 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is $52.50 (the February 25 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). Remaining in inventory is the March 20 receipt of 50 units ($1.08 drawback/unit). Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $391.00.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period</E>—(A) <E T="03">Method.</E> Under the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into the inventory in the established average inventory turn-over period preceding the withdrawal.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Accounting for withdrawals (for domestic shipments and for export).</E> Under this method, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Establishment of inventory turn-over period.</E> For purposes of this section, average inventory turn-over period is based on the rate of withdrawal from inventory and represents the time in which all of the merchandise or articles in the inventory at a given time must have been withdrawn. To establish an average of this time, at least 1 year, or three (3) turn-over periods (if inventory turns over less than 3 times per year), must be averaged. The inventory turn-over period must be that for the merchandise or articles to be identified, except that if the person using the method has more than one kind of merchandise or articles with different inventory turn-over periods, the longest average turn-over period established under this section may be used (instead of using a different inventory turn-over period for each kind of merchandise or article).</P>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Example.</E> In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals, and with an established average inventory turn-over period of 30 days), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the preceding 30 days with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $101.50 (the January 20 and January 25 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $51.50 (the February 20 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). No drawback may be claimed on the basis of the January 5 receipt or the February 25 receipt because in the case of each, there were insufficient withdrawals for export within the established average inventory turn-over period; the 50 units remaining from the January 2 receipt after the January 15 withdrawal are <PRTPAGE P="537"/>not identified for a withdrawal for export because there is no other withdrawal for export (other than the January 15 withdrawal) within the established average inventory turn-over period; the March 20 receipt (50 units at $1.08) is not yet attributed to withdrawals for export. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $341.00.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Low-to-high blanket method</E>—(A) <E T="03">Method.</E> Under the low-to-high blanket method, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into inventory in the period preceding the withdrawal equal to the statutory period for export under the kind of drawback involved (e.g., 180 days under 19 U.S.C. 1313(p), 3 years under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c) and 1313(j), and 5 years otherwise under 19 U.S.C. 1313(i)). Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import more than 5 years (more than 3 years for 19 U.S.C. 1313(j); more than 180 days after the date of import or after the close of the manufacturing period for 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)) before the claimed export, no drawback could be granted).</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Accounting for withdrawals (for domestic shipments and for export).</E> Under this method, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Example.</E> In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the inventory with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $50.00 (the remainder of the January 2 receipt and the January 5 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $50.50 (the February 20 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $96.00 (the March 25 and January 25 receipts). Receipts not attributed to withdrawals for export are the January 31 (50 units at $1.03), February 25 (50 units at $1.05), March 5 (50 units at $1.06), and March 20 (50 units at $1.08) receipts. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $286.50.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Average</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The average method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified on the basis of the calculation by recordkeeping of the amount of drawback that may be attributed to each unit of merchandise or articles in the inventory. In this method, the ratio of:</P>
            <P>(A) The total units of a particular receipt of the fungible merchandise in the inventory at the time of a withdrawal to;</P>
            <P>(B) The total units of all receipts of the fungible merchandise (including each receipt into inventory) at the time of the withdrawal;</P>

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example.</E> In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $133 (50 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit, 33 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, and 17 units from the receipt on the 5th with $0 drawback <PRTPAGE P="538"/>attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 100 units from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal) and 25 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 50 units from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 75 units (with 50 with $1 drawback/unit and 25 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit, 25 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (50 with $2 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 75 units from the receipt on the 15th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal), 33 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 50 units remaining from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal, and 17 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 25 units remaining from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 50 units (25 with $2 drawback/unit, 17 with $1 drawback/unit, and 8 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios).</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Inventory turn-over for limited purposes.</E> A properly established average inventory turn-over period, as provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, may be used to determine:</P>
            <P>(i) The fact and date(s) of use in manufacture or production of the imported designated merchandise and other (substituted) merchandise (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(b)); or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Methods of claiming drawback.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Used in.</E> Drawback may be paid based on the amount of the imported or substituted merchandise used in the manufacture of the exported article, where there is no waste or the waste is valueless or unrecoverable. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is no valuable waste (see paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appearing in.</E> Drawback is allowable under this method based only on the amount of imported or substituted merchandise that appears in (is contained in) the exported articles. This method may not be used if there are multiple products also necessarily and concurrently resulting from the manufacturing process.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Used in less valuable waste.</E> Drawback is allowable under this method based on the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture the exported or destroyed article, reduced by an amount equal to the quantity of this merchandise that the value of the waste would replace. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is valuable waste.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Abstract or schedule.</E> A drawback claimant may use either the abstract or schedule method to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported or destroyed article. An abstract is the summary of records which shows the total quantity used in or appearing in all articles produced during the period covered by the abstract. A schedule shows the quantity of material used in producing, or appearing in, each unit of product. Manufacturers or producers submitting letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.7) and applicants for approval of specific manufacturing drawback rulings (see § 191.8) shall state whether the abstract or schedule method is used; if no such statement is made, drawback claims must be based upon the abstract method.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Recordkeeping</E>—(1) <E T="03">Valuable waste.</E> When the waste has a value and the drawback claim is not limited to the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback, the manufacturer or producer shall keep records to show the market value of the merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles, as well as the market value of the resulting waste, under the used in less valuable waste method (see § 191.2(u) of this part).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">If claim for waste is waived.</E> If claim for waste is waived, only the “appearing in” basis may be used (see paragraph (b) of this section). Waste <PRTPAGE P="541"/>records need not be kept unless required to establish the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback.</P>

The claim on the chemical element that is the designated merchandise must be limited to the duty apportioned to that element on a unit-for-unit attribution using the unit of measure set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) that is applicable to the imported material. If the material is a compound with other constituents, including impurities, and the purity of the compound in the imported material is shown by satisfactory analysis, that purity, converted to a decimal equivalent of the percentage, is multiplied against the entered amount of the material to establish the amount of pure compound. The amount of the element in the pure compound is to be determined by use of the atomic weights of the constituent elements and converting to the decimal equivalent of their respective percentages and multiplying that decimal equivalent against the above-determined amount of pure compound.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (b)(4):</HD>

              <P>Synthetic rutile that is shown by appropriate analysis in the entry papers to be 91.7% pure titanium dioxide is imported and dutiable at a 5% <E T="03">ad valorem</E> duty rate. The amount of imported synthetic rutile is 30,000 pounds with an entered value of $12,000. The total duty paid is $600. Titanium in the synthetic rutile is designated as the basis for a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). The amount of titanium dioxide in the synthetic rutile is determined by converting the purity percentage (91.7%) to its decimal equivalent (.917) and multiplying the entered amount of synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds) by that decimal equivalent (.917 × 30,000 = 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide contained in the 30,000 pounds of imported synthetic rutile). The titanium, based on atomic weight, represents 59.93% of the <PRTPAGE P="543"/>constituents in titanium dioxide. Multiplying that percentage, converted to its decimal equivalent, by the amount of titanium dioxide determines the titanium content of the imported synthetic rutile (.5993 × 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide = 16,486.7 pounds of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile). Therefore, up to 16,486.7 pounds of titanium is available to be designated as the basis for drawback. As the per-unit duty paid on the synthetic rutile is calculated by dividing the duty paid ($600) by the amount of imported synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds), the per-unit duty is two cents of duty per pound of the imported synthetic rutile ($600 ÷ 30,000 = $0.02). The duty on the titanium is calculated by multiplying the amount of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile by two cents of duty per pound (16,486.7 × $0.02 = $329.73 duty apportioned to the titanium). The product is then multiplied by 99% to determine the maximum amount of drawback available ($329.73 × .99 = $326.44). If an exported titanium alloy ingot weighs 17,000 pounds, in which 16,000 pounds of titanium was used to make the ingot, drawback is determined by multiplying the duty per pound ($0.02) by the weight of the titanium contained in the ingot (16,000 pounds) to calculate the duty available for drawback ($0.02 × 16,000 = $320.00). Because only 99% of the duty can be claimed, drawback is determined by multiplying this available duty amount by 99% (.99 × $320.00 = $316.80). As the oxygen content of the titanium dioxide is 45% of the synthetic rutile, if oxygen is the designated merchandise on another drawback claim, 45% of the duty claimed on the synthetic rutile would be available for drawback based on the substitution of oxygen.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Valuable waste records.</E> When waste has a value and the manufacturer, producer, or claimant, has not limited the claims based on the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise appearing in the articles exported or destroyed, the manufacturer or producer shall keep records to show the market value of the merchandise used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed article, as well as the quantity and market value of the waste incurred (see § 191.2(u) of this part). In such records, the quantity of merchandise identified or designated for drawback, under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or 1313(b), respectively, shall be based on the quantity of merchandise actually used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles. The waste replacement reduction will be determined by reducing from the quantity of merchandise actually used the amount of merchandise which the value of the waste would replace.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Purchase of manufactured articles for exportation.</E> Where the claimant purchases articles from the manufacturer and exports them, the claimant shall file the related certificate of manufacture and delivery as part of the claim (see § 191.51(a)(1) of this part).</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedures</E>—(i) <E T="03">Submission of letter.</E> Each drawback claimant shall file a separate letter, as part of the claim, describing the component article on the export bill of lading to which each claim will relate. Each letter shall show the name of the claimant and bear a statement that the claim shall be limited to its respective component article. The exporter shall endorse the letters, as required, to show the respective interests of the claimants.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Retention; submission to Customs.</E> The certificate of delivery shall be retained by the party to whom the merchandise or article covered by the certificate was delivered.

            <P>Section 313(c) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(c)), provides for drawback upon the exportation or destruction under Customs supervision of imported merchandise which has been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, duty-paid; and which does not conform to sample or specifications; has been shipped without the consent of the consignee; or has been determined to be defective as of the time of importation. The claimant must show by evidence satisfactory to Customs that the exported or destroyed merchandise was defective at the time of importation, or was not in accordance with sample or specifications, or was shipped without the consent of the consignee (see subpart P for drawback of internal-revenue taxes for unmerchantable or nonconforming distilled spirits, wines, or beer).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Return to Customs custody.</E> The claimant must return the merchandise to Customs custody within 3 years after the date the merchandise was originally released from Customs custody. Drawback will be denied on merchandise returned to Customs custody after the statutory 3-year time period or exported or destroyed without return to Customs custody.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Required documentation.</E> The claimant shall submit documentation to the drawback office as part of the drawback claim to establish that the merchandise did not conform to sample or specification, was shipped without the consent of the consignee, or was defective as of the time of importation. If the claimant was not the importer, the claimant must:</P>
            <P>(1) Submit a statement signed by the importer and every other person, other than the ultimate purchaser, that owned the goods that no other claim for drawback was made on the goods by any other person; and</P>
            <P>(2) Certify that records are available to support the statement required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice.</E> A notice of intent to export or destroy merchandise which may be the subject of a rejected merchandise drawback claim (19 U.S.C. 1313(c)) must be provided to the Customs Service to give Customs the opportunity to examine the merchandise. The claimant, or the exporter (for destruction, see § 191.44), must file at the port of intended redelivery to Customs custody a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on Customs Form 7553 at least 5 working days prior to the date of intended return to Customs custody. Waiver of prior notice for exportations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j) (see § 191.91 of this part) is inapplicable to exportations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Required Information.</E> The notice shall provide the bill of lading number, if known, the name and telephone number, mailing address, and, if available, fax number and e-mail address of a contact person, and the location of the merchandise.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Decision to waive examination.</E> Within two (2) working days after receipt of the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback (see paragraph (c) of this section), Customs will notify, in writing, the party designated on the Notice of Customs decision to either examine the merchandise to be exported or destroyed, or to waive examination. If Customs timely notifies the designated party, in writing, of its <PRTPAGE P="551"/>decision to examine the merchandise (see paragraph (f) of this section), but the merchandise is exported or destroyed without having been presented to Customs for such examination, any drawback claim, or part thereof, based on the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback, shall be denied. If Customs notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to waive examination of the merchandise, or, if timely notification of a decision by Customs to examine or to waive examination is absent, the merchandise may be exported or destroyed without delay and shall be deemed to have been returned to Customs custody.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Time and place of examination.</E> If Customs gives timely notice of its decision to examine the merchandise to be exported or destroyed, the merchandise to be examined shall be promptly presented to Customs. Customs shall examine the merchandise within five (5) working days after presentation of the merchandise. The merchandise may be exported or destroyed without examination if Customs fails to timely examine the merchandise after presentation to Customs, and in such case the merchandise shall be deemed to have been returned to Customs custody. If the examination is completed at a port other than the port of actual exportation or destruction, the merchandise shall be transported in-bond to the port of exportation or destruction.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Extent of examination.</E> The appropriate Customs office may permit release of merchandise without examination, or may examine, to the extent determined to be necessary, the items exported or destroyed.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Drawback claim.</E> When filing the drawback claim, the drawback claimant must correctly calculate the amount of drawback due (see § 191.51(b) of this part). The procedures for restructuring a claim (see § 191.53 of this part) shall apply to rejected merchandise drawback if the claimant has an ongoing export program which qualifies for this type of drawback.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Exportation.</E> The claimant shall export the merchandise and shall provide documentary evidence of exportation (see subpart G of this part). The claimant may establish exportation by mail as set out in § 191.74 of this part.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General</E>—(1) <E T="03">Complete claim.</E> Unless otherwise specified, a complete drawback claim under this part shall consist of the drawback entry on Customs Form 7551, applicable certificate(s) of manufacture and delivery, applicable Notice(s) of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback, applicable import entry number(s), coding sheet unless the data is filed electronically, and evidence of exportation or destruction under subpart G of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Certificates.</E> Additionally, at the time of the filing of the claim, the associated certificate(s) of delivery must be in the possession of the party to whom the merchandise or article covered by the certificate was delivered. Any required certificate(s) of manufacture and delivery, if not previously filed with Customs, must be filed with the claim.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Drawback due</E>—(1) <E T="03">Claimant required to calculate drawback.</E> Drawback claimants are required to correctly calculate the amount of drawback due. The amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry is generally to be <PRTPAGE P="552"/>99 percent of the import duties eligible for drawback. (For example, if $1,000 in import duties are eligible for drawback less 1 percent ($10), the amount claimed on the drawback entry should be for $990.) Claims exceeding 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will not be paid until the calculations have been corrected by the claimant. Claims for less than 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will be paid as filed, unless the claimant amends the claim in accordance with § 191.52(c).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Merchandise processing fee apportionment calculation.</E> Where a drawback claimant seeks unused merchandise drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(j), or drawback for substitution of finished petroleum derivatives pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)(2)(A)(iii) or (iv), for a merchandise processing fee paid pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(A), the claimant is required to correctly apportion the fee to that merchandise that provides the basis for drawback when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry. This is determined as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Relative value ratio for each line item.</E> The value of each line item of entered merchandise subject to a merchandise processing fee is calculated (to four decimal places) by dividing the value of the line item subject to the fee by the total value of entered merchandise subject to the fee. The resulting value forms the relative value ratio.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item.</E> To apportion the merchandise processing fee to each line item, the relative value ratio for each line item is multiplied by the merchandise processing fee paid.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per line item.</E> The amount of merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item is multiplied by 99 percent to calculate that portion of the fee attributable to each line item that is eligible for drawback.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise.</E> To calculate the amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise, the line item amount that is eligible for drawback is divided by the number of units covered by that line item (to two decimal places).

If 1,000 widgets form the basis of a claim for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j), the total amount of drawback attributable to the merchandise processing fee is $14.10 (1,000 × .0141 = $14.10).

Participation in the program is voluntary. Under the program, Customs is required to inform potential drawback claimants and related parties clearly about their rights and obligations under the drawback law and regulations. Reduced penalties and/or warning letters may be issued once a party has been certified for the program, and is in general compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements thereof.</P>

Whether the party is a drawback claimant, a broker, or one that provides data and documentation on which a drawback claim is based, will also be considered.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Broker certification.</E> A Customs broker may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program only on behalf of a given claimant (see § 191.194(b)). To do so, a Customs broker who is employed to assist a claimant in filing for drawback must be able to demonstrate, for and on behalf of such claimant, conformity with the core requirements of the drawback compliance program as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Review by applicable drawback office</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> It is the responsibility of the drawback office where the drawback compliance application package is filed to coordinate its decision making on the package both with CBP Headquarters and with the other field drawback offices as appropriate. CBP processing of the package will consist of the review of the information contained therein as well as any additional <PRTPAGE P="581"/>information requested (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Criteria for CBP review.</E> The drawback office shall review and verify the information submitted in and with the application. In order for CBP to evaluate the application, CBP may request additional information (including additional sample documents) and/or explanations of any of the information provided for in § 191.193(c) and (d) of this subpart. Based on the information submitted on and with the application and any information so requested, and based on the applicant's record of transactions with CBP, the drawback office will approve or deny the application. The criteria to be considered in reviewing the applicant's record with CBP shall include (as applicable):</P>
            <P>(i) The presence or absence of unresolved customs charges (duties, taxes, or other debts owed CBP);</P>
            <P>(ii) The accuracy of the claimant's past drawback claims; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Whether accelerated payment of drawback or waiver of prior notice of intent to export was previously revoked or suspended.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Approval.</E> Certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program will be given to applicants whose applications are approved under the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The applicable drawback office will give written notification to an applicant of its certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program. A Customs broker obtaining certification for a drawback claimant will be sent written notification on behalf of such claimant, with a copy of the notification also being sent to the claimant.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Benefits of participation in program.</E> When a party that has been certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program and is generally in compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements of the program commits a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1593a(a) (see § 191.62(b) of this part), CBP shall, in the absence of fraud or repeated violations, and in lieu of a monetary penalty as otherwise provided under § 1593a, issue a written notice of the violation to the party. Repeated violations by a participant, including a CBP broker, may result in the issuance of penalties and the removal of certification under the program until corrective action, satisfactory to CBP, is taken.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Denial.</E> If certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program is denied to an applicant, the applicant shall be given written notice by the applicable drawback office, specifying the grounds for such denial, together with any action that may be taken to correct the perceived deficiencies, and informing the applicant that such denial may be appealed to the appropriate drawback office and then appealed to CBP Headquarters.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification removal</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grounds for removal.</E> The certification for participation in the drawback compliance program by a party may be removed when any of the following conditions are discovered:</P>
            <P>(i) The certification privilege was obtained through fraud or mistake of fact;</P>
            <P>(ii) The program participant is no longer in compliance with the customs laws and CBP regulations, including the requirements set forth in § 191.192;</P>
            <P>(iii) The program participant repeatedly files false drawback claims or false or misleading documentation or other information relating to such claims; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The program participant is convicted of any felony or has committed acts which would constitute a misdemeanor or felony involving theft, smuggling, or any theft-connected crime.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Removal procedure.</E> If CBP determines that the certification of a program participant should be removed, the applicable drawback office will serve the program participant with written notice of the removal. Such notice will inform the program participant of the grounds for the removal and will advise the program participant of its right to file an appeal of the removal in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of removal.</E> The removal of certification will be effective immediately in cases of willfulness on the part of the program participant or when required by public health, interest, or safety. In all other cases, the removal of certification will be effective <PRTPAGE P="582"/>when the program participant has received notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and either no appeal has been filed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or all appeal procedures have been concluded by a decision that upholds the removal action. Removal of certification may subject the affected person to penalties.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeal of certification denial or removal</E>—(1) <E T="03">Appeal of certification denial.</E> A party may challenge a denial of an application for certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program by filing a written appeal, within 30 days of issuance of the notice of denial, with the applicable drawback office. A denial of an appeal may itself be appealed to CBP Headquarters, Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade, within 30 days after issuance of the applicable drawback office's appeal decision. CBP Headquarters will review the appeal and will respond with a written decision within 30 days after receipt of the appeal unless circumstances require a delay in issuance of the decision. If the decision cannot be issued within the 30-day period, CBP Headquarters will advise the appellant of the reasons for the delay and of any further actions which will be carried out to complete the appeal review and of the anticipated date for issuance of the appeal decision.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Appeal of certification removal.</E> A party who has received a CBP notice of removal of certification for participation in the drawback compliance program may challenge the removal by filing a written appeal, within 30 days after issuance of the notice of removal, with the applicable drawback office. A denial of an appeal may itself be appealed to CBP Headquarters, Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade, within 30 days after issuance of the applicable drawback office's appeal decision. CBP Headquarters will consider the allegations upon which the removal was based and the responses made to those allegations by the appellant and will render a written decision on the appeal within 30 days after receipt of the appeal.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">D. General Statement</HD>
            <P>The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">E. Process of Manufacture or Production</HD>
            <P>Heated crude oil is charged to an atmospheric distillation tower where it is subjected to fractionation. The charge to the distillation tower consists of a single crude oil, or of commingled crudes which are fed to the tower simultaneously or after blending in a tank. During fractionation, components of different boiling ranges are separated.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Relative Values</HD>
            <P>Fractionation results in 17 products. In order to insure proper distribution of drawback to each of these products, the manufacturer or producer agrees to record the relative values as the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract is to be treated at the time of separation. The value per unit of each product shall be the average market value for the abstract period.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Producibility</HD>

            <P>The manufacturer or producer can vary the proportionate quantity of each product. The manufacturer or producer understands that drawback is payable on exported products only to the extent that these products could have been produced from the designated merchandise. The records of the manufacturer or producer will show that all of the products exported for which drawback will be claimed under this general manufacturing drawback <PRTPAGE P="594"/>ruling could have been produced concurrently on a practical operating basis from the designated merchandise.</P>
            <P>The manufacturer or producer agrees to establish the amount to be designated by reference to the Industry Standards of Potential Production published in T.D. 66-16. <SU>2</SU>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">G. Loss or Gain</HD>
            <P>Because the manufacturer or producer keeps records on a volume basis rather than a weight basis, it is anticipated that the material balance will show a volume gain. For the same reason, it is possible that occasionally the material balance will show a volume loss. Fluctuations in type of crude used, together with the type of finished product desired make an estimate of an average volume gain meaningless. However, records will be kept to show the amount of loss or gain with respect to the production of export products.</P>

            <P>The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">I. Procedures and Records Maintained</HD>
            <P>Records will be maintained to establish:</P>
            <P>1. The identity and specifications of the merchandise designated;</P>
            <P>2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise used to produce the exported articles.</P>
            <P>3. That, within 3 years after receiving it at its refinery, the manufacturer or producer used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced the exported articles.</P>
            <P>4(a). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use a 28-31 day period (monthly) abstract period for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling, or</P>
            <P>(b). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use an abstract period (not to exceed 1 year) for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer certifies that if it were to file abstracts covering each manufacturing period of not less than 28 days and not more than 31 days (monthly) within the longer period, in no such monthly abstract would the quantity of designated merchandise exceed, for the same class of designated merchandise, the material introduced into the manufacturing process during that monthly period. (Select (a) or (b), and state which is selected in the application, and, if (b) is selected, specify the length of the particular abstract period chosen (not to exceed 1 year (see General Instruction I.A.7.)).)</P>
            <P>5. On each abstract of production the manufacturer or producer agrees to show the value per barrel to five decimal places.</P>
            <P>6. The manufacturer or producer agrees to file claims in the format set forth in exhibits A through F which are attached to this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer realizes that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. It is understood that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance. Records will be kept in accordance with T.D. 84-49, as amended by T.D. 95-61.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">J. Residual Rights</HD>
            <P>It is understood that the refiner can reserve as the basis for future payment the right to drawback only on the number of barrels of raw material computed by subtracting from Line E the larger of Lines A or B, of a given Exhibit E. It is further understood that this right to future payment can be claimed only against products concurrently producible with the products listed in Column 21, in the quantities shown in Column 22 of such Exhibit E. Such residual right can be transferred to another refinery of the same refiner only when Line B of Exhibit E is larger than Line A. Unless the number of residual barrels is specifically computed and rights thereto are expressly reserved on Exhibit E, such residual rights shall be deemed waived. The procedure the manufacturer or producer shall follow in preparing drawback entries claiming this residual right is illustrated in the attached sample Exhibit E-1. It is understood that claims involving residual rights shall be filed only at the port where the Exhibit E reserving such right was filed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">K. Inventory Procedures</HD>

            <P>The manufacturer or producer realizes that inventory control is of major importance. In accordance with the normal accounting procedures of the manufacturer or producer, each refinery prepares a monthly stock and yield report, which accounts for inventories, <PRTPAGE P="595"/>production and disposals from time of receipt to time of disposition. This provides an audit trail of all products.</P>
            <P>The above-noted records will provide the required audit trail from the initial source documents to the drawback claims of the manufacturer or producer and will support adherence with the requirements discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">L. Basis of Claim for Drawback</HD>
            <P>The amount of raw material on which drawback may be based shall be computed by multiplying the quantity of each product exported by the drawback factor for that product. The amount of any one type and class of raw material which may be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products produced at a given refinery and covered by a drawback entry shall not exceed the quantity of such raw material used at the refinery during the abstract period or periods from which the exported products were produced. The quantity of raw material to be designated as the basis for drawback on exported products must be at least as great as the quantity of raw material of the same type and class which would be required to produce the exported products in the quantities exported.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">M. Agreements</HD>
            <P>The manufacturer or producer specifically agrees that it will:</P>

They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.</TNOTE>
            </GPOTABLE>
            <P>The piece goods used in manufacture will be the same kind and quality as the piece goods designated as the basis of claim for drawback, and are used interchangeably without change in manufacturing processes or resultant products (including, if applicable, multiple products), or wastes. Some tolerances between imported-designated piece goods and the used-exported piece goods will be permitted to accommodate variations which are normally found in piece goods. These tolerances are no greater than the tolerances generally allowed in the industry for piece goods of the same kind and quality as follows:</P>
            <P>1. A 4% weight tolerance so that the piece goods used in manufacture will be not more than 4% lighter or heavier than the imported piece goods which will be designated;</P>

            <P>2. A tolerance of 4% in the aggregate thread count per square inch so that the piece goods used in manufacture will have an aggregate thread count within 4%, more or less of the aggregate thread count of the imported piece goods which will be designated. In each case, the average yarn number of the domestic piece goods will be the same or greater than the average yarn number of the imported piece goods designated, and in each case, the substitution and tolerance will be employed only within the same family of fabrics, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> print cloth for print cloth, gingham for gingham, greige for greige, dyed for dyed, bleached for bleached, etc. The piece goods used in manufacture of the exported articles will be designated as containing the identical percentage of identical fibers as the piece goods designated as the basis for allowance of drawback; for example, piece goods containing 65% cotton and 35% dacron will be designated against the use of piece goods shown to contain 65% cotton and 35% dacron. The actual fiber composition may vary slightly from that described on the invoice or other acceptance of the fabric as having the composition described on documents in accordance with trade practices. The substituted piece goods used in the manufacture of articles for exportation with drawback will be so similar in quality to the imported piece goods designated for the basis of allowance of drawback, that the piece goods used, if imported, would have been subject to the same or greater amount of duty as was paid on the imported designated piece goods. Differences in value resulting from factors other than quality, as for example, price fluctuations, will not preclude an allowance of drawback.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">XI. General Manufacturing Drawback Ruling under 19 U.S.C. 1313(<E T="01">b</E>) for Raw Sugar (T.D. 83-59)</HD>
            <P>Drawback may be allowed under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) upon the exportation of hard or soft refined sugars and sirups manufactured from raw sugar, subject to the following special requirements:</P>
            <P>A. The drawback allowance shall not exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on a quantity of raw sugar designated by the refiner which contains a quantity of sucrose not in excess of the quantity required to manufacture the exported sugar or sirup, ascertained as provided in this general rule.</P>
            <P>B. The refined sugars and sirups shall have been manufactured with the use of duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic sugar, or combinations thereof, within 3 years after the date on which designated sugar was received by the refiner, and shall have been exported within 5 years from the date of importation of the designated sugar.</P>
            <P>C. All granulated sugar testing by the polariscope 99.5° and over shall be deemed hard refined sugar. All refined sugar testing by the polariscope less than 99.5° shall be deemed soft refined sugar. All “blackstrap,” “unfiltered sirup,” and “final molasses” shall be deemed sirup.</P>
            <P>D. The imported duty-paid sugar selected by the refiner as the basis for the drawback claim (designated sugar) shall be of the same kind and quality as that used in the manufacture of the exported refined sugar or sirup and shall have been used within 3 years after the date on which it was received by the refiner. Duty-paid sugar which has been used at a plant of a refiner within 3 years after the date on which it was received by such refiner may be designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on refined sugars or sirups manufactured at another plant of the same refiner.</P>
            <P>E. For the purpose of distributing the drawback, relative values shall be established between hard refined (granulated) sugar, soft refined (various grades) sugar, and sirups at the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract shall be deemed the time of separation of the sugars and sirups covered by such abstract.</P>
            <P>F. The sucrose allowance per pound on hard refined (granulated) sugar established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, shall be applied to hard refined sugar commercially known as loaf, cut loaf, cube, pressed, crushed, or powdered sugar manufactured from the granulated sugar covered by the abstract.</P>
            <P>G. The sucrose allowance per gallon on sirup established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, shall be applied to sirup further advanced in value by filtration or otherwise, unless such sirup is the subject of a special manufacturing drawback ruling.</P>
            <P>H. As to each lot of imported or domestic sugar used in the manufacture of refined sugar or sirup on which drawback is to be claimed, the raw stock records shall show the refiner's raw lot number, the number and character of the packages, the settlement weight in pounds, and the settlement polarization. Such records covering imported sugar shall show, in addition to the foregoing, the import entry number, date of importation, name of importing carrier, country of origin, the Government weight, and the Government polarization.</P>
            <P>I. The melt records shall show the date of melting, the number of pounds of each lot of raw sugar melted, and the full analysis at melting.</P>
            <P>J. There shall be kept a daily record of final products boiled showing the date of the melt, the date of boiling, the magma filling serial number, the number of the vacuum pan or crystallizer filling, the date worked off, and the sirup filling serial number.</P>
            <P>K. The sirup manufacture records shall show the date of boiling, the period of the melt, the sirup filling serial number, the number of barrels in the filling, the magma filling serial number, the quantity of sirup, its disposition in tanks or barrels and the refinery serial manufacture number.</P>
            <P>L. The refined sugar stock records shall show the refinery serial manufacture number, the period of the melt, the date of manufacture, the grade of sugar produced, its polarization, the number and kind of packages, and the net weight. When soft sugars are manufactured, the commercial grade number and quantity of each shall be shown.</P>

            <P>M. Each lot of hard or soft refined sugar and each lot of sirup manufactured, regardless of the character of the containers or vessels in which it is packed or stored, shall be marked immediately with the date of manufacture and the refinery manufacture number applied to it in the refinery records provided for and shown in the abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, from such records. If all the sugar or sirup contained in any lot manufactured is not intended for exportation, only such of the packages as are intended for exportation need be marked as prescribed above, provided there is filed with the drawback office immediately after such marking a statement showing the date of manufacture, the refinery manufacture number, the number of packages marked, and the <PRTPAGE P="607"/>quantity of sugar or sirup contained therein. No drawback shall be allowed in such case on any sugar or sirup in excess of the quantity shown on the statement as having been marked. If any packages of sugar or sirup so marked are repacked into other containers, the new containers shall be marked with the marks which appeared on the original containers and a revised statement covering such repacking and remarking shall be filed with the drawback office. If sirups from more than one lot are stored in the same tank, the refinery records shall show the refinery manufacture number and the quantity of sirup from each lot contained in such tank.</P>
            <P>N. An abstract from the foregoing records covering manufacturing periods of not less than 1 month nor more than 3 months, unless a different period shall have been authorized, shall be filed when drawback is to be claimed on any part of the refined sugar or sirup manufactured during such period.

            <P>1. The duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used instead of the imported, duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be interchangeable for manufacturing purposes with the duty-paid steel. To be interchangeable a steel must be able to be used in place of the substituted steel without any additional processing step in the manufacture of the article on which drawback is to be claimed.</P>

            <P>2. Because the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) that is to be designated as the basis for drawback is dutiable according to its value, the amount of duty can vary with its size (gauge, width, or length) or composition (e.g., chrome content). If such variances occur, designation will be by “price extra”, and in no case will drawback be claimed in a greater amount than that which would have accrued to that steel used in manufacture of or appearing in the exported articles. Price extra is not available for coated or plated steel, covered in paragraph 5, <E T="03">infra,</E> insofar as the coating or plating is concerned.</P>
            <P>3. The duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be so similar in quality to the steel used to manufacture the articles on which drawback will be claimed that the steel so used, if imported, would be classifiable in the same tariff subheading number and at the same rate of duty as the duty-paid imported steel.</P>
            <P>4. Any fluctuation in market value caused by a factor other than quality does not affect drawback.</P>
            <P>5. If the steel is coated or plated with a base metal, in addition to meeting the requirements for uncoated or unplated steel set forth in the parallel columns, the base-metal coating or plating on the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used in place of the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will have the same composition and thickness as the coating or plating on the duty-paid steel. If the coated or plated duty-paid steel is within a SAE, AISI, ASTM specification, any duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic coated or plated steel covered by the same specification and grade (if two or more grades are in the specification) is considered to meet this criterion for “same kind and quality.”</P>

They may be designated as the basis for drawback and also may be deemed to be domestic merchandise.)</TNOTE>
            </GPOTABLE>
            <FP>(Following the items listed in the parallel columns, a statement will be made, by the applicant, that affirms the “same kind and quality” of the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:)</FP>
            <P>The imported merchandise which we will designate on our claims will be so similar in quality to the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the imported designated merchandise.</P>
            <P>Fluctuations in the market value resulting from factors other than quality will not affect the drawback.</P>
            <FP>(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise is the “same kind and quality”. “Same kind and quality” does not necessarily mean that the merchandise is identical. It does mean that the merchandise is of the same nature or character (“same kind”) and that the merchandise to be substituted is interchangeable with the imported merchandise with little or no change in the manufacturing process to produce the same exported article (“same quality”). In order to enable Customs to rule on “same kind and quality”, the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise to be used to produce the exported articles.)</FP>

            <FP>(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the quality of the merchandise are provided in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the “same kind and quality” statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different qualities. For example, USDA standards; FDA standards; industry standards, e.g., ASTM; concentration; specific gravity; purity; luster; melting point, boiling point; odor; color; grade; type; hardness; brittleness; etc. Note that these are only a few examples of characteristics and that each kind <PRTPAGE P="616"/>of merchandise has its own set of specifications that characterizes its quality. If specifications are given with a minimum value, be sure to include a maximum value. The converse is also true. Often characteristics are given to Customs on attached specification sheets. These specifications should not include Material Safety Data sheets or other descriptions of the merchandise that do not contribute to the “same kind and quality” determination. When the merchandise is a chemical, state the chemical's generic name as well as its trade name plus any generally recognized identifying number, e.g., CAS number; Color Index Number, etc.)</FP>
            
            <FP>(In order to expedite the specific manufacturing drawback ruling process, it will be helpful if you provide copies of technical standards/specifications (particularly industry standards such as ASTM standards) referred to in your application.)</FP>
            <FP>(The descriptions of the “same kind and quality” merchandise should be formatted in the parallel columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and specifications of the designated imported merchandise under the heading set forth above. The right-hand column will consist of the name and specifications for the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise under the heading set forth above.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED</HD>
            <FP>(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION</HD>
            <FP>(Drawback under § 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 191.2(q). In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, give equations of the chemical reactions. The attachment of a flow chart in addition to the description showing the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating whether or not a manufacture or production has occurred. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)</FP>
            <FP>(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the parallel columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">MULTIPLE PRODUCTS</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Relative Values</HD>
            <FP>(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise used in the same operation into two or more products. List all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)</FP>
            <FP>Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products necessarily are produced concurrently in the same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders does not call for relative value distribution.)</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1500 or <FR>1/5</FR>. The relative value of B is <FR>2/15</FR> and of product C is <FR>2/3</FR>, calculated in the same manner. This means that <FR>1/5</FR> of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A, <FR>2/15</FR> to product B, and <FR>2/3</FR> to product C.)</FP>

            <FP>(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not allowable on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) the nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)<PRTPAGE P="617"/>
            </FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Producibility</HD>
            <FP>(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)</FP>
            
            <FP>(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state “Not Applicable” for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation state “Not Applicable” for this sub-section.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">WASTE</HD>
            <FP>(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.)</FP>
            <FP>(If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)</FP>
            <FP>(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)</FP>
            <FP>(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what “Basis” you are using.)</FP>
            
            <FP>(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in producing the exported articles (less valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">STOCK IN PROCESS</HD>
            <FP>(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).</FP>
            
            <FP>(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">TRADEOFF</HD>
            <FP>(If an applicant proposes to use tradeoff (19 CFR 191.11), the applicant should so state and the applicant should describe the contractual arrangement between the applicant and its partner for tradeoff. The person claiming drawback under the tradeoff provision has the burden of establishing compliance with the law and regulations. In this regard, the terms of a written contract are always easier to establish than those of an oral contract.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)</HD>

            <FP>(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or <PRTPAGE P="618"/>quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)</FP>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">INVENTORY PROCEDURES</HD>
            <FP>(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">SHIPPING RECORDS</FP>
            <FP>(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g. within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is well to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.)</FP>
            <FP>(If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, a statement that the legal requirements will be met by your inventory procedures is acceptable. However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application a judgement as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it does not constitute approval of the applicant's record keeping procedures if, for example, those procedures are merely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK</HD>
            <FP>(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Used In” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used In” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.)</FP>
            <FP>(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)</FP>

            <FP>(The “Appearing In” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “Appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “Appearing In” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of material designated, <PRTPAGE P="619"/>which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. “Appearing In” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds “Used In” or the 90 pounds “Appearing In” as set forth in the above examples.)</FP>
            <FP>(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)</FP>
            <FP>(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)</FP>
            <FP>(An “abstract” is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)</FP>
            <FP>(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base his claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule follows:)</FP>
            <P>We shall claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.</P>
            <FP>(Section 191.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)</FP>
            <P>We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.</P>
            <FP>(Neither the “Appearing In” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)</FP>

            </GPOTABLE>
            <FP>(Following the items listed in the parallel columns, a statement will be made, by the applicant, that affirms the “same kind and quality” of the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:)</FP>

            <P>The imported merchandise which we will designate on our claims will be so similar in <PRTPAGE P="622"/>quality to the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the imported designated merchandise.</P>
            <P>Fluctuations in the market value resulting from factors other than quality will not affect the drawback.</P>
            <FP>(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise is the “same kind and quality”. “Same kind and quality” does not necessarily mean that the merchandise is identical. It does mean that the merchandise is of the same nature or character (“same kind”) and that the merchandise to be substituted is interchangeable with the imported merchandise with little or no change in the manufacturing process to produce the same exported article (“same quality”). In order to enable Customs to rule on “same kind and quality”, the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise to be used to produce the exported articles.)</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the quality of the merchandise are provided in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the “same kind and quality” statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different qualities. For example, USDA standards; FDA standards; industry standards, e.g., ASTM; concentration; specific gravity; purity; luster; melting point, boiling point; odor; color; grade; type; hardness; brittleness; etc. Note that these are only a few examples of characteristics and that each kind of merchandise has its own set of specifications that characterizes its quality. If specifications are given with a minimum value, be sure to include a maximum value. The converse is also true. Often characteristics are given to Customs on attached specification sheets. These specifications should not include Material Safety Data sheets or other descriptions of the merchandise that do not contribute to the “same kind and quality” determination. When the merchandise is a chemical, state the chemical's generic name as well as its trade name plus any generally recognized identifying number, e.g., CAS number; Color Index Number, etc.)</FP>
            <FP>(In order to expedite the specific manufacturing drawback ruling review process, it will be helpful if you provide copies of technical standards/specifications (particularly industry standards such as ASTM standards) referred to in your application.)</FP>
            <FP>(The descriptions of the “same kind and quality” merchandise should be formatted in the parallel columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and specifications of the designated imported merchandise under the heading set forth above. The right-hand column will consist of the name and specifications for the duty-paid, duty-free or domestic merchandise under the heading set forth above.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED</HD>
            <FP>(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION</HD>
            <FP>(Drawback under § 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 191.2(q). In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, give equations of the chemical reactions. The attachment of a flow chart in addition to the description showing the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating whether or not a manufacture or production has occurred. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)</FP>
            <FP>(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the parallel columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">MULTIPLE PRODUCTS</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Relative Values</HD>
            <FP>(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise used in the same operation into two or more products. List all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product or by-product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)</FP>

            <FP>(Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products necessarily are produced concurrently in the <PRTPAGE P="623"/>same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders does not call for relative value distribution.)</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1500 or <FR>1/5</FR>. The relative value of B is <FR>2/15</FR> and of product C is <FR>2/3</FR>, calculated in the same manner. This means that <FR>1/5</FR> of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A, <FR>2/15</FR> to product B, and <FR>2/3</FR> to product C.)</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not allowable on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) the nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Producibility</HD>
            <FP>(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)</FP>
            <FP>(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state “Not Applicable” for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation state “Not Applicable” for this sub-section.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">WASTE</HD>
            <FP>(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.)</FP>
            <FP>(If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)</FP>
            <FP>(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)</FP>
            <FP>(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what “Basis” you are using.)</FP>
            
            <FP>(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in producing the exported articles less valuable waste, state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">STOCK IN PROCESS</HD>

            <FP>(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” <PRTPAGE P="624"/>or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).</FP>
            
            <FP>(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">TRADEOFF</HD>
            <FP>(If an applicant proposes to use tradeoff (19 CFR 191.11), the applicant should so state and the applicant should describe the contractual arrangement between the applicant and its partner for tradeoff. The person claiming drawback under the tradeoff provisions has the burden of establishing compliance with the law and regulations. In this regard, the terms of a written contract are always easier to establish than those of an oral contract.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)</HD>
            <FP>(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED</HD>
            <P>We will maintain records to establish:</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">INVENTORY PROCEDURES</HD>
            <FP>(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">SHIPPING RECORDS</FP>
            <FP>(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g., within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is well to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.)</FP>

            <FP>(If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, a statement that the legal requirements will be met by your inventory procedures is acceptable. However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application a judgement as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it <PRTPAGE P="625"/>does not constitute approval of the applicant's record keeping procedures if, for example, those procedures are merely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK</HD>
            <FP>(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Used In” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used In” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.)</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Appearing In” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “Appearing In” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “Appearing In” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of material designated, which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. “Appearing In” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)</FP>
            <FP>(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)</FP>
            <FP>(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds “Used In” or the 90 pounds “Appearing In” as set forth in the above examples.)</FP>
            <FP>(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)</FP>
            <FP>(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)</FP>
            <FP>(An “abstract” is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)</FP>

            <FP>(An original application and two copies must be filed. If the applicant intends to file drawback claims at more than one drawback office, one additional copy of the application must be furnished for each additional office indicated.)</FP>

            <FP>(The exact material placed under this heading in individual cases will vary, but it should include such information as the type of business in which the manufacturer is engaged, whether the manufacturer is manufacturing for his own account or is performing the operation on a toll basis (including commission or conversion basis) for the account of others, whether the manufacturer is a direct exporter of his products or sells or delivers them to others for export, and whether drawback will be claimed by the manufacturer or by others.)</FP>
            <FP>(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1), and § 191.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (see § 191.7 and Appendix A), or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.8 and this Appendix B).)</FP>
            <FP>(Regarding drawback operations conducted under § 1313(d), the data may describe the flavoring extracts, medicinal, or toilet preparations (including perfumery) manufactured with the use of domestic tax-paid alcohol; and where such alcohol is obtained or purchased.)</FP>
            <FP>(Since the permission to grant use of the accelerated payment procedure rests with the Drawback office with which claims will be filed, do not include any reference to that procedure in this application.)</FP>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">EXPORTED ARTICLES ON WHICH DRAWBACK WILL BE CLAIMED</HD>
            <FP>(Name each article to be exported)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION</HD>
            <FP>(Drawback under § 1313(d) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. “Manufacture or production” is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 191.2(q). In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(d), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by giving a thorough description of the manufacturing process. Describe how the tax-paid material is processed into the export article.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">WASTE</HD>
            <FP>(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.) (If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)</FP>
            <FP>(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)</FP>
            <FP>(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation, does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what “Basis” you are using.)</FP>
            
            <PRTPAGE P="628"/>
            <FP>(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in producing the exported articles (less valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. See “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">STOCK IN PROCESS</HD>
            <FP>(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).</FP>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that the domestic tax-paid alcohol is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the domestic tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">LOSS OR GAIN (Separate and distinct from WASTE)</HD>
            <FP>(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED</HD>
            <P>We will maintain records to establish:</P>
            <P>1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of a particular lot (or lots) of domestic tax-paid alcohol, and</P>

            </FTNT>
            <P>We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the tax has been paid on the domestic alcohol. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">INVENTORY PROCEDURES</HD>
            <FP>(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(d) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following areas should be included in your discussion:)</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">RECEIPT AND RAW STOCK STORAGE RECORDS</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">MANUFACTURING RECORDS</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">FINISHED STOCK STORAGE RECORDS</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK</HD>
            <FP>(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Used In” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used In” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of flavoring extracts and medicinal or toilet preparation (including perfumery).)</FP>
            <FP>(For example, if 100 gallons of alcohol, valued at $1.00 per gallon, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 100% of the tax paid on the 100 gallons of domestic alcohol used to produce the exported articles.)</FP>

            <P>The “Appearing In” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the <PRTPAGE P="629"/>“Appearing In” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “Appearing In” basis. Drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol which appears in the exported articles.</P>
            <FP/>
            <FP>(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 gallons of domestic alcohol which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 gallons used in as set forth previously.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of domestic tax-paid alcohol. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the quantity of tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the exported articles, reduced by the quantity of such alcohol which the value of the waste would replace.)</FP>
            <FP>(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 gallons of waste had a value of $.50 per gallon, then the 10 gallons of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 gallons of the tax-paid alcohol. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 gallons of the alcohol used, and drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on 95 gallons of alcohol rather than on the 100 gallons “Used In” or the 90 gallons “Appearing In” as set forth in the above examples.)</FP>
            <FP>(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)</FP>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT</HD>
            <FP>(What is required here is a clear, concise description of the process of construction and equipment involved. The description should also trace the flow of materials through the manufacturing process for the purpose of establishing physical identification of the imported merchandise or drawback products and of the articles resulting from the processing.)</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">WASTE</HD>
            <FP>(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a positive statement to that effect under this heading.)</FP>
            <FP>(If waste occurs, state: (1) whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)</FP>
            <FP>(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)</FP>
            <FP>(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what “Basis” you are using.)</FP>
            <FP>(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise used in producing the exported articles (less valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered.

            <FP>(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. State the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)</FP>

              <FTREF/> we used in producing the exported article.</P>

            <PRTPAGE P="632"/>
            <P>We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">INVENTORY PROCEDURES</HD>
            <FP>(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313 and part 191 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To insure compliance the following should be included in your discussion:)</FP>
            
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">RECEIPT AND RAW STOCK STORAGE RECORDS</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT RECORDS</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">SHIPPING RECORDS</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">BASIS OF CLAIM FOR DRAWBACK</HD>
            <FP>(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) Appearing In; and (3) Used less Valuable Waste.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Used In” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used In” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported article.)</FP>
            <FP>(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duty paid on the 100 pounds of imported material used in constructing and equipping the exported articles.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Appearing In” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “Appearing In” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “Appearing In” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the quantity of imported material which appears in the exported articles. “Appearing In” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)</FP>
            <FP>(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of imported material which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)</FP>
            <FP>(The “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “Used Less Valuable Waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duty paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported product, reduced by the quantity of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Thus in this case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 191.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)</FP>
            <FP>(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the imported material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duty paid on the 95 pounds of imported material rather than on the 100 pounds “Used In” or the 90 pounds “Appearing In” as set forth in the above examples.)</FP>
            <FP>(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)</FP>
            <FP>(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production;)</FP>
            <FP>(An “abstract” is the summary of the records (which may be set forth on Customs Form 7551) which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a duration of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back on how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)</FP>
            

            <FP>(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base his claims on <PRTPAGE P="633"/>the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule would read:)</FP>
            <P>We shall claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.</P>
            <FP>(Section 191.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)</FP>
            <P>We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.</P>
            <FP>(Neither the “Appearing In” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)</FP>

Exportation of a vehicle will be permitted only upon compliance with these requirements, unless the vehicle was entered into the United States under an in-bond procedure, or under a carnet or Temporary Importation Bond; a vehicle entered under an in-bond procedure, or under a carnet or Temporary Importation Bond is exempt from these requirements. The person attempting to export the vehicle may employ an agent for the exportation of the vehicle.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Documentation required</E>—(1) <E T="03">For U.S.-titled vehicles</E>—(i) <E T="03">Vehicles issued an original certificate of title.</E> For used, self-propelled vehicles issued, by any jurisdiction in the United States, a Certificate of Title or a Salvage Title that remains in force, the owner must provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original Certificate of Title or a certified copy of <PRTPAGE P="635"/>the Certificate of Title and two complete copies of the original Certificate of Title or certified copy of the original.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Where title evidences third-party ownership/claims.</E> If the used, self-propelled vehicle is leased or a recorded lien exists in the U.S., in addition to complying with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the provisional owner must provide to Customs a separate writing from the third-party-in-interest which expressly provides that the subject vehicle may be exported. This writing must be on the third-party's letterhead paper, and contain a complete description of the vehicle including the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), the name of the owner or lienholder of the leased vehicle, and the telephone numbers at which that owner or lienholder may be contacted. The writing must bear an original signature of the third-party and state the date it was signed.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Where U.S. Government employees are involved.</E> If the used, self-propelled vehicle is owned by a U.S. government employee and is being exported in conjunction with that employee's reassignment abroad pursuant to official travel orders, then, in lieu of complying with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the employee may be required to establish that he has complied with the sponsoring agency's internal travel department procedures for vehicle export.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">For foreign-titled vehicles.</E> For used, self-propelled vehicles that are registered or titled abroad, the owner must provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original document that provides satisfactory proof of ownership (with an English translation of the text if the original language is not in English), and two complete copies of that document (and translation, if necessary).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Description of the AES.</SUBJECT>

            <P>AES is a voluntary program that allows all exporters required to report commodity export information (<E T="03">see,</E> 15 CFR 30.16) to submit such information electronically, rather than on paper, and sea carriers to report required outbound vessel information electronically (<E T="03">see,</E> §§ 4.63, 4.75, and 4.76 of this chapter). Eligibility and application procedures are found at subpart E of part 30 of the Census Regulations (15 CFR part 30, subpart E), denominated Electronic Filing Requirements—Exporters. These Census Regulations (15 CFR part 30, subpart E) provide that exporters may choose to submit export information through AES by any one of three electronic filing options available. Only Option 4, the complete post-departure submission of export information, requires prior approval by participating agencies before it can be used by AES participants.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Criteria for denial of applications requesting AES post-departure (Option 4) filing status; appeal procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval process.</E> Applications for the option of filing export commodity information electronically through AES after the vessel has departed (Option 4 filing status) must be unanimously approved by Customs, Census and other participating government agencies. Disapproval by one of the participating agencies will cause rejection of the application.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grounds for denial.</E> Customs may deny a participant's application for any of the following reasons:</P>
            <P>(1) The applicant is not an exporter, as defined in the Census Regulations (15 CFR 30.7(d));</P>
            <P>(2) The applicant has a history of non-compliance with export regulations (e.g., exporter has a history of late electronic submission of commodity records or a record of non-submission of required export documentation);</P>
            <P>(3) The applicant has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under an investigation, wherein Customs has developed probable cause, for a felony involving any Customs law or any export law administered by another government agency; or</P>
            <P>(4) The applicant has made or caused to be made in the “Letter of Intent”, a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of denial; appeal procedures.</E> Applicants will be notified of approval or denial in writing by Census. (Applicants whose applications are denied by other agencies must contact those agencies for their specific appeal procedures.) Applicants whose applications are denied by Customs will be provided with the specific reason(s) for non-selection. Applicants may challenge Customs decision by following the appeal procedure provided at § 192.13(b).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Revocation of participants' AES post-departure (Option 4) filing privileges; appeal procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Reasons for revocation.</E> Customs may revoke Option 4 privileges of participants for the following reasons:</P>
            <P>(1) The exporter has made or caused to be made in the “Letter of Intent”, a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact;</P>
            <P>(2) The exporter submitting the “Letter of Intent” is indicted, convicted, or is currently under an investigation, wherein Customs has developed probable cause, for a felony involving any Customs law or any export law administered by another government agency;</P>
            <P>(3) The exporter fails to substantially comply with export regulations; or</P>
            <P>(4) Continued participation in AES as an Option 4 filer would pose a threat to national security, such that continued participation in Option 4 should be terminated.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of revocation; appeal procedures.</E> When Customs has decided to revoke a participant's Option 4 filing privileges, the participant will be notified in writing of the reason(s) for the decision. The participant may challenge Customs decision by filing an appeal within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the notice of decision. Except as stated elsewhere in this paragraph, the revocation will become effective when the participant has either exhausted all appeal proceedings or thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice of revocation if no appeal is filed. However, in cases of intentional violations of any Customs law on the part of the program participant or when required by the national security, revocations will become effective immediately upon notification. Appeals should be addressed to the Director, Outbound Programs, U.S. Customs, Ronald Reagan Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Room 5.4c, Washington, DC 20229. Customs will issue a written decision or notice of extension to the participant within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the appeal. If a notice of extension is forwarded, the applicant will be provided with the reason(s) for extension of this time period and an expected date of decision. Participants who have had their Option 4 filing privileges revoked and applicants not selected to participate in Option 4 of AES may not reapply for this filing status for one year following written notification of rejection or revocation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Electronic information for outward cargo required in advance of departure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> Pursuant to section 343(a), Trade Act of 2002, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2071 note), for any commercial cargo that is to be transported out of the United States by vessel, aircraft, rail, or truck, unless exempted under paragraph (d) of this section, the United States Principal Party in Interest (USPPI), or its authorized agent, must electronically transmit for receipt by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), no later than the time period specified in paragraph (b) of this section, certain cargo information, as enumerated in paragraph (c) of this section. Specifically, to effect the advance electronic transmission of the required cargo information to CBP, the USPPI or its authorized agent must use a CBP-approved electronic data interchange system (currently, the Automated Export System (AES)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Presentation of data</E>—(1) <E T="03">Time for presenting data.</E> USPPIs or their authorized agents must electronically transmit and verify system acceptance of required cargo information for outbound cargo no later than the time period specified as follows (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section):</P>
            <P>(i) For vessel cargo, the USPPI or its authorized agent must transmit and verify system acceptance of export vessel cargo information no later than 24 hours prior to departure from the U.S. port where the vessel cargo is to be laden;</P>
            <P>(ii) For air cargo, including cargo being transported by Air Express Couriers, the USPPI or its authorized agent must transmit and verify system acceptance of export air cargo information no later than 2 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the aircraft from the last U.S. port;</P>
            <P>(iii) For truck cargo, including cargo departing by Express Consignment Courier, the USPPI or its authorized agent must transmit and verify system acceptance of export truck cargo information no later than 1 hour prior to the arrival of the truck at the border; and</P>
            <P>(iv) For rail cargo, the USPPI or its authorized agent must transmit and verify system acceptance of export rail cargo information no later than two hours prior to the arrival of the train at the border.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicability of time frames.</E> The time periods in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for reporting required export cargo information to CBP for outward vessel, air, truck, or rail cargo only apply to shipments without an export license, that require full pre-departure reporting of shipment data, in order to comply with the advance cargo information filing requirements under section 343(a), as amended. Paragraph (e) of this section details dates for compliance with the time frames provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Requirements placed on exports controlled by other Government agencies will remain in force unless changed by the agency having the regulatory authority to do so. The CBP will also continue to require 72-hour advance notice for used vehicle exports pursuant to § 192.2(c)(1) and (c)(2)(i) of this part. USPPIs or their authorized agents should refer to the relevant titles of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for pre-filing requirements of other Government agencies. In particular, for the advance reporting requirements for exports of U.S. Munitions List items, see the U.S. Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">System verification of data acceptance.</E> Once the USPPI or its authorized agent has transmitted the data required under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, and the CBP-approved electronic system has received and accepted this data, the system will generate and transmit to the USPPI or its authorized agent (whichever is the filer in AES) a confirmation number (this number is known as the Internal Transaction Number (ITN)), which verifies that the data has been accepted as transmitted for the outgoing shipment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Information required</E>—(1) <E T="03">Currently collected commodity data.</E> The export cargo information to be collected from USPPIs or their authorized agents for outbound cargo is already contained in the Bureau of Census electronic Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) that <PRTPAGE P="639"/>the USPPI or its authorized agent currently presents to CBP through the approved electronic system. The AES Commodity Module already captures the requisite export data, so no new data elements for export cargo are required under this section. The export cargo data elements that are required to be reported electronically through the approved system are also found in § 30.63 of the Bureau of Census Regulations (15 CFR 30.63).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Transportation data.</E> Reporting of the following transportation information is currently mandatory for AES participants under 15 CFR 30.63 for the vessel, air, truck, and rail modes (see also paragraph (c)(3) of this section):</P>
            <P>(i) Method of transportation (the method of transportation is defined as that by which the goods are exported or shipped (vessel, air, rail, or truck));</P>
            <P>(ii) Carrier identification (for vessel, rail and truck shipments, the unique carrier identifier is the 4-character Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC); for aircraft, the carrier identifier is the 2- or 3-character International Air Transport Association (IATA) code);</P>
            <P>(iii) Conveyance name (the conveyance name is the name of the carrier; for sea carriers, this is the name of the vessel; for others, the carrier name);</P>
            <P>(iv) Country of ultimate destination (this is the country as known to the USPPI or its authorized agent at the time of exportation, where the cargo is to be consumed or further processed or manufactured; this country would be identified by the 2-character International Standards Organization (ISO) code for the country of ultimate destination);</P>
            <P>(v) Estimated date of exportation (the USPPI or its authorized agent must report the date the cargo is scheduled to leave the United States for all modes of transportation; if the actual date is not known, the USPPI or its authorized agent must report the best estimate as to the time of departure); and</P>
            <P>(vi) Port of exportation (the port where the outbound cargo departs from the United States is designated by its unique code, as set forth in Annex C, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); the USPPI or its authorized agent must report the port of exportation as known when the USPPI or its agent tenders the cargo to the outbound carrier; should the carrier export the cargo from a different port and the carrier so informs the USPPI or agent, the port of exportation must be corrected by the filer in AES.).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Proof of electronic filing; exemption from filing.</E> The USPPI, or its authorized agent, must furnish to the outbound carrier a proof of electronic filing citation (the ITN), low-risk exporter citation (currently, the Option 4 filing citation), or exemption statement, for annotation on the carrier's outward manifest, waybill, or other export documentation covering the cargo to be shipped. The proof of electronic filing citation, low-risk exporter citation, or exemption statement, will conform to the approved data formats found in the Bureau of Census Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR) (15 CFR part 30) and FTSR Letter 168, Amendment 2 (this Letter may be obtained from the Census Bureau).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Carrier responsibility</E>—(i) <E T="03">Loading of cargo.</E> The carrier may not load cargo without first receiving from the USPPI or its authorized agent either the related electronic filing citation as prescribed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or an appropriate exemption statement for the cargo as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">High-risk cargo.</E> For cargo that CBP has identified as potentially high-risk, the carrier, after being duly notified by CBP, will be responsible for delivering the cargo for inspection/examination. If the cargo identified as high risk has already departed, CBP may demand that the export carrier redeliver the cargo in accordance with the terms of its international carrier bond (see § 113.64(k)(2) of this chapter).</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">USPPI receipt of information believed to be accurate.</E> Where the USPPI or its authorized agent electronically presenting the cargo information required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section receives any of this information from another party, CBP will take into consideration how, in accordance with ordinary commercial practices, the USPPI or its authorized agent acquired this information, and <PRTPAGE P="640"/>whether and how the USPPI or authorized agent is able to verify this information. Where the USPPI or authorized agent is not reasonably able to verify any information received, CBP will permit this party to electronically present the information on the basis of what it reasonably believes to be true.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemptions from reporting; Census exemptions applicable.</E> The USPPI or authorized agent must furnish to the outbound carrier an appropriate exemption state-ment (low-risk exporter or other exemption) for any export shipment laden that is not subject to pre-departure electronic information filing under this section. The exemption statement will conform to the proper format approved by the Bureau of Census. Any exemptions from reporting requirements for export cargo are enumerated in §§ 30.35 through 30.40 of the Bureau of Census Regulations (15 CFR 30.35 through 30.40). These exemptions are equally applicable under this section.</P>
