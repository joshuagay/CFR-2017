      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2016), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <P>(a) Pursuant to chapter 15 of title 44, United States Code, the Director of the Federal Register shall publish periodically a special edition of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to present a compact and practical code called the “Code of Federal Regulations”, to contain each Federal regulation of general applicability and legal effect.</P>
            <P>(b) The Administrative Committee intends that every practical means be used to keep the Code as current and readily usable as possible, within limitations imposed by dependability and reasonable costs.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Orderly development.</SUBJECT>
            <P>To assure orderly development of the Code of Federal Regulations along practical lines, the Director of the Federal Register may establish new titles in the Code and rearrange existing titles and subordinate assignments. However, before taking an action under this section, the Director shall consult with each agency directly affected by the proposed change.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Periodic updating.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Each book of the Code shall be updated at least once each calendar year. If no change in its contents has occurred during the year, a simple notation to that effect may serve as the supplement for that year. More frequent updating of any unit of the Code may be made whenever the Director of the Federal Register determines that the content of the unit has been substantially superseded or otherwise determines that such action would be consistent with the intent and purpose of the Administrative Committee as stated in § 8.1.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Staggered publication.</E> The Code will be produced over a 12-month period under a staggered publication system to be determined by the Director of the Federal Register.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Cutoff dates.</E> Each updated title of the Code will reflect each amendment to that title published as a codified regulation in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on or before the “As of” date. Thus, each title updated as of July 1 each year will reflect all amendatory documents appearing in the daily <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on or before July 1.</P>

          <P>(a) Section 552(a) of title 5, United States Code, provides, in part, that “matter reasonably available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> when incorporated by reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register.”</P>

          <P>(b) The Director will interpret and apply the language of section 552(a) together with other requirements which govern publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the Code of Federal Regulations. Those requirements which govern publication include—</P>
          <P>(1) The Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>)</P>
          <P>(2) The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>
          <P>(3) The regulations of the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register under the Federal Register Act (1 CFR Ch. I); and</P>
          <P>(4) The acts which require publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (See CFR volume entitled “CFR Index and Finding Aids.”)</P>
          <P>(c) The Director will assume in carrying out the responsibilities for incorporation by reference that incorporation by reference—</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purposes.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The purposes of the Administrative Conference are—</P>
          <P>(a) To provide suitable arrangements through which Federal agencies, assisted by outside experts, may cooperatively study mutual problems, exchange information, and develop recommendations for action by proper authorities to the end that private rights may be fully protected and regulatory activities and other Federal responsibilities may be carried out expeditiously in the public interest;</P>
          <P>(b) To promote more effective public participation and efficiency in the rulemaking process;</P>
          <P>(c) To reduce unnecessary litigation in the regulatory process;</P>
          <P>(d) To improve the use of science in the regulatory process; and</P>
          <P>(e) To improve the effectiveness of laws applicable to the regulatory process.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 301.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Organization.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States is appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a five-year term.</P>
          <P>(b) The Council consists of the Chairman and 10 other members who are appointed by the President for three-year terms, of whom not more than one-half may be employees of Federal regulatory agencies or Executive departments.</P>
          <P>(c) The total membership of the Conference may not, by statute, be lower than 75 or higher than 101. It comprises, in addition to the Council, approximately 50 Government members (from Executive departments and agencies designated by the President and independent regulatory boards or commissions) and approximately 40 non-Government or public members appointed by the Chairman with the approval of the Council (lawyers in private practice, scholars in the field of administrative law or government, or others specially informed by knowledge and experience with respect to Federal administrative procedure). Public members are selected so as to provide broad representation of the views of private citizens and utilize diverse experience.</P>
          <P>(d) Members of the Conference, except the Chairman, are not entitled to pay for service; although public members are entitled to travel reimbursement.</P>
          <P>(e) The membership is divided into six standing committees, each assigned a broad area of interest as follows: Adjudication, Administration, Public Processes, Judicial Review, Regulation, and Rulemaking.</P>

          <P>(f) The membership meeting in plenary session is called the Assembly of the Administrative Conference. The Council must call at least one plenary session each year. The Assembly has <PRTPAGE P="44"/>authority to adopt bylaws for carrying out the functions of the Conference.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 301.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Activities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Conference may study the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedure used by administrative agencies in carrying out administrative programs. Subjects for inquiry by the Conference are developed by the Chairman, the Council, the committees, and the Assembly. The committees, with the assistance of staff and consultants, conduct thorough studies of these subjects and develop proposed recommendations and supporting reports. Reports and recommendations are considered by the Council and distributed to the membership, with the views and recommendations of the Council, to be placed on the agenda of a plenary session. The Assembly has complete authority to approve, amend, remand, or reject recommendations presented by the committees. The deliberations of the Assembly are public. Recommendations may be made to administrative agencies, collectively or individually, and to the President, Congress, or the Judicial Conference of the United States, as the Conference considers appropriate.</P>
          <P>(b) The Conference may arrange for interchange among administrative agencies of information potentially useful in improving administrative procedure, collect information and statistics from administrative agencies and publish such reports as it considers useful for evaluating and improving administrative procedure, and enter into arrangements with any administrative agency or major organizational unit within an administrative agency pursuant to which the Conference performs any of the functions described in this section.</P>
          <P>(c) The Conference may provide assistance in response to requests relating to the improvement of administrative procedure in foreign countries, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State or the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, as appropriate, except that:</P>
          <P>(1) Such assistance shall be limited to the analysis of issues relating to administrative procedure, the provision of training of foreign officials in administrative procedure, and the design or improvement of administrative procedure, where the expertise of members of the Conference is indicated; and</P>
          <P>(2) Such assistance may only be undertaken on a fully reimbursable basis, including all direct and indirect administrative costs.</P>
          <P>(d) For purposes of this section:</P>
          <P>(1) “Administrative program” includes a Federal function which involves protection of the public interest and the determination of rights, privileges, and obligations of private persons through rulemaking, adjudication, licensing, or investigation, except that it does not include a military or foreign affairs function of the United States; and</P>
          <P>(2) “Administrative procedure” means procedure used in carrying out an administrative program and is to be broadly construed to include any aspect of agency organization, procedure, or management which may affect the equitable consideration of public and private interests, the fairness of agency decisions, the speed of agency action, and the relationship of operating methods to later judicial review, but does not include the scope of agency responsibility as established by law or matters of substantive policy committed by law to agency discretion.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 301.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Office of the Chairman.</SUBJECT>

          <P>The Chairman is the chief executive of the Conference. The Chairman presides at meetings of the Council and at each plenary session of the Conference. Among his powers is the authority to encourage Federal agencies to adopt the recommendations of the Conference. The Chairman is also authorized to make inquiries into matters he considers important for Conference consideration, including matters proposed by individuals inside or outside the Federal Government. The purpose of such inquiries is not to review the results in particular cases, but rather to determine whether the problems should be made the subject of Conference study in the interests of developing fair and effective procedures for such cases. Upon request of the head of an agency, the Chairman is authorized to furnish assistance and advice on matters of administrative procedure. <PRTPAGE P="45"/>The Chairman may request agency heads to provide information needed by the Conference, which information shall be supplied to the extent permitted by law.</P>

            <P>(a) This subpart contains the rules that the Administrative Conference of the United States (“ACUS” or “the agency”) follows in processing requests for disclosure of records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA” or “the Act”), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and in meeting its responsibilities under the Act. Note that electronic records are treated as records for the purposes of the FOIA. These rules should be read together with the text of the FOIA itself, which provides additional information about access to records maintained by the agency. They also may be read in conjunction with the agency's “Freedom of Information Act Reference Guide,” which provides basic information about use of the Act in relation to the agency's records. Requests made by individuals for access to records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a (2006 &amp; Supp. II 2008), which are processed under subpart B of this part, are also processed under this subpart. The agency will automatically process the request under both provisions in order to provide the maximum possible records to the requester. Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular agency activity (for example, press releases or recommendations adopted by the agency pursuant to the Administrative Conference Act, 5 U.S.C. 591 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) may be provided to the public without following this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) As a matter of policy, ACUS makes discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever it is determined that disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.</P>

            <P>(c) The agency has designated its General Counsel as its Chief FOIA Officer, who has agency-wide responsibility <PRTPAGE P="46"/>for efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA and these implementing regulations. The General Counsel has designated the agency's Deputy General Counsel as its FOIA Public Liaison.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Public reading room.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) ACUS maintains a public reading room that affords access to the records that the FOIA requires it to make regularly available for public inspection and copying even in the absence of a FOIA request, including a current subject-matter index of its reading room records that will be updated quarterly with respect to newly included records.</P>

            <P>(b) ACUS also makes all reading room records that have been created by the agency regularly available to the public electronically on its Web site (<E T="03">http://www.acus.gov</E>).</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 304.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requirements for making requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> You may make a request for records by sending an e-mail message addressed to <E T="03">info@acus.gov,</E> or by using the FOIA Request form on the ACUS Web site at <E T="03">http://www.acus.gov/foia.</E> You may also send a written request letter to the agency either by mail addressed to FOIA Public Liaison, Administrative Conference of the United States, 1120 20th Street, NW., South Lobby, Suite 706, Washington, DC 20036, or by fax delivery to (202) 386-7190. For the quickest possible handling of a mail request, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope “Freedom of Information Act Request.” (You may find the agency's “Freedom of Information Act Reference Guide”—which is available on its Web site and in paper form—helpful in making your request.) If you are making a request for records about yourself, see § 304.21(d) for additional requirements. If you are making a request for records about another individual, then either a written authorization signed by that individual permitting disclosure of those records to you or proof that that individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary notice) will help the processing of your request. Your request will be considered received as of the date upon which it is logged in as received by the agency's FOIA Public Liaison.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable agency personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. If known, you should include any file designations or similar descriptions for the records that you want. As a general rule, the more specific you are about the records or type of records that you want, the more likely that the agency will be able to locate those records in response to your request. If the agency determines that your request does not reasonably describe records, then it will tell you either what additional information is needed or why your request is otherwise insufficient. It also will give you an opportunity to discuss your request by telephone so that you may modify it to meet the requirements of this section. Additionally, if your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek, the agency's response to it may be delayed as an initial matter.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> When you make a FOIA request, it will be considered to be an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under § 304.9, up to $50.00, unless you specifically request a waiver of fees. The agency ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount. Your agreement will not prejudice your ability to seek a waiver or reduction of any applicable fee at a later time.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 304.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responsibility for responding to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The agency will be responsible for responding to a request in all respects, except in the case of a referral to another agency as is described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. In determining which records are responsive to a request, the agency ordinarily will include only records in its possession and control as of the date upon which it begins its search for <PRTPAGE P="47"/>them. If any other date is used, the agency will inform the requester of that date.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultations and referrals.</E> When the agency receives a request for a record in its possession and control, it will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA and, if so, whether it should be disclosed as a matter of administrative discretion. If the agency determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it will do so. If the agency determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it will either:</P>
            <P>(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency that is best able to determine whether to disclose it and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or</P>
            <P>(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency is subject to the FOIA). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of referral.</E> When the agency refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it ordinarily will notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of the agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</E> All consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date upon which the FOIA request initially was received by the first agency, and not any later date.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.</E> The agency may make agreements with other agencies designed to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals regarding particular types of records.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 304.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The agency ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multi-track processing.</E> The agency may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, including according to the number of pages involved. If it does so, then it will advise requesters in its slower track(s) of the limits of its faster track(s) and may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of its faster track(s). The agency will contact the requester by telephone, e-mail or letter, whichever is most efficient, in each case.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> (1) Where the statutory time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the agency determines to extend the time limits on that basis, it will as soon as practicable notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension is for more than ten business days, it will provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an alternative time period processing the request or a modified request.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, they may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>
            <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>

            <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal <PRTPAGE P="48"/>government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Other circumstances as determined by the agency.</P>
            <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records (i.e., as part of the initial request) or at any later time.</P>
            <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the news media, must establish that he or she is a person whose main professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. That requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The formality of certification may be waived by the agency as a matter of administrative discretion.</P>
            <P>(4) Within ten calendar days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing, the agency will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, then the request will be given priority and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, then any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 304.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgments of requests.</E> On receipt of a request, if the agency cannot provide the requested information within two business days, then an acknowledgment letter or e-mail message will be sent to the requester that will confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under § 304.3(c) and will provide a request tracking number for further reference. Requesters may use this tracking number to determine the status of their request—including the date of its receipt and the estimated date on which action on it will be completed—by calling the agency's FOIA Public Liaison at (202) 480-2080. In some cases, the agency may seek further information or clarification from the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> Ordinarily, the agency will have twenty business days from when a request is received to determine whether to grant or deny the request. Once the agency makes such a determination, it will immediately notify the requester in writing. The agency will inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under § 304.9 and will disclose records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fee. Records disclosed in part will be marked or annotated to show the amount of information deleted, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted also will be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests.</E> Whenever the agency makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The denial letter will include:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
            <P>(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied by the agency in denying the request;</P>

            <P>(3) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate <PRTPAGE P="49"/>would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and</P>
            <P>(4) An indication on the released portion of a record of each exemption applied, at the place at which it was applied, if technically feasible.</P>
            <P>(5) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 304.8(a) and a description of the requirements of § 304.8(a).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Business information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Business information obtained by the agency will be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section and in accordance with Executive Order 12,600, 3 CFR part 235 (1988).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) “Business information” means privileged or confidential commercial or financial information obtained by the agency from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(2) “Submitter” means any person or entity from whom the agency obtains business information, either directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of business information.</E> A submitter of business information will use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any and all portion(s) of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> The agency will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its business information wherever required under paragraph (e) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information under paragraph (f) of this section. The notice will either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish it.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Where notice is required.</E> Notice will be given to a submitter wherever:</P>
            <P>(1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
            <P>(2) The agency has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> The agency will allow a submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section and will specify that time period within the notice. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it is required to submit a detailed written statement. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, it must show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. In the event that a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified in it, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is not received by the agency until after its disclosure decision has been made will not be considered by the agency. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> The agency will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever the agency decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, it will give the submitter written notice, which will include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</P>

            <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.<PRTPAGE P="50"/>
            </P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section will not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) The agency determines that the information should not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12,600; or</P>
            <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous—except that, in such a case, the agency will, within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the agency will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Corresponding notice to requesters.</E> Whenever the agency provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, it will also notify the requester(s). Whenever the agency notifies a submitter of its intent to disclose requested information under paragraph (g) of this section, it will also notify the requester(s). Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, the agency will notify the requester(s).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Appeals of adverse determinations.</E> If you are dissatisfied with the response to your request, you may appeal an adverse determination denying your request, in any respect, to the Chairman of the agency. You must make your appeal in writing, by e-mail or letter, and it must be received by the agency within 60 days of the date of the agency's response denying your request. Your appeal should provide reasons and supporting information as to why the initial determination was incorrect. The appeal should clearly identify the particular determination (including the assigned request number, if known) that you are appealing. For the quickest possible handling of a mail request, you should mark your appeal “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” The Chairman or his or her designee will act on the appeal, except that an appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Responses to appeals.</E> The decision on your appeal will be made by e-mail or letter, ordinarily within 20 business days of receipt of your appeal. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will contain a statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied, and will inform you of the FOIA provisions for court review of the decision. (You also may be aware of the mediation services that are offered by the Office of Government Information Services (“OGIS”) of the National Archives and Records Administration—<E T="03">see http://www.archives.gov/ogis/</E>—as a non-exclusive alternative to FOIA litigation.) If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal, in whole or in part, then you will be notified in a written decision and your request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> As a general rule, if you wish to seek review by a court of any adverse determination, you must first appeal it in a timely fashion under this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The agency will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section, where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (k) of this section, or where the agency's FOIA staff waives fees in whole or in part because they are deemed to be inappropriate or unreasonable—and in some cases the agency may seek further information or clarification from the requester for this purpose. The agency ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of requested records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.<PRTPAGE P="51"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) “Commercial use request” means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, including furthering those interests through litigation. The agency will determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because the agency has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, the agency will provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.</P>
            <P>(2) “Direct costs” means those expenses that an agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.</P>
            <P>(3) “Duplication” means the making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others. The agency will honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.</P>
            <P>(4) “Educational institution” means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, that operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify under this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(5) “Noncommercial scientific institution” means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To qualify under this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research.</P>

            <P>(6) “Representative of the news media,” or “news-media requester,” means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. For this purpose, the term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the agency may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination. To qualify under this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for a <PRTPAGE P="52"/>commercial use. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(7) “Review” means the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any record for disclosure—for example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under § 304.7 but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(8) “Search” means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. The agency will conduct searches in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible. For example, it will not search on a line-by-line basis where duplicating an entire document would be quicker and less expensive.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees charged.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, the agency will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Search.</E> (i) Search fees will be charged for all requests (other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media) subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. The agency may charge for time spent searching even if it does not locate any responsive record or if it withholds the record(s) located as entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(ii) For each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching for and retrieving a requested record, the fee will be $5.00. Where a search and retrieval cannot be performed entirely by clerical personnel (for example, where the identification of records within the scope of a request requires the use of professional personnel) the fee will be $10.00 for each quarter hour of search time spent by professional personnel. Where the time of managerial personnel is required, the fee will be $15.00 for each quarter hour of time spent by those personnel.</P>
            <P>(iii) For computer searches of records, requesters will be charged the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) will be charged no search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) will be entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time without charge. These direct costs will include the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), the fee will be ten cents per page. For copies produced by computer, such as tapes, disks, or printouts, the agency will charge the direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. For other forms of duplication, the agency will charge the direct costs of that duplication.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> Review fees will be charged to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees will be charged only for the initial record review, when the agency determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record portion at the initial request level. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level regarding an exemption already applied. However, records or record portions withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies; the costs of that review are chargeable where it is made necessary by such a change of circumstances. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those used for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations on charging fees.</E> (1) No search fee will be charged for requests <PRTPAGE P="53"/>by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.</P>
            <P>(2) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.</P>
            <P>(3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the agency will provide without charge:</P>
            <P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent).</P>
            <P>(4) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $20.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.</P>
            <P>(5) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section work together. This means that for requesters other than those seeking records for a commercial use, no fee will be charged unless the cost of search in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages totals more than $20.00.</P>
            <P>(6) In the case of any request on which the agency does not comply with any of the time limits of the FOIA and for which no “unusual or exceptional circumstances” exist, as those terms are defined by the FOIA, the agency will not charge any search fee or, for such requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, will not charge any duplication fee.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $50.00.</E> When the agency determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section will amount to more than $50.00, it will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the agency will advise the requester that the estimated fee might be only a portion of the total fee. In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $50.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until the requester agrees to pay the total anticipated fee. Any such agreement should be memorialized in writing. A notice under this paragraph will offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter with agency personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> Apart from the other provisions of this section, when the agency chooses as a matter of administrative discretion to provide a special service—such as certifying that records are true copies or sending them by other than ordinary mail—the direct costs of providing the service ordinarily will be charged.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The agency may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of the billing of the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by the agency. The agency will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Public Law 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749, as amended, and regulations pursuant thereto.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> Wherever the agency reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, it may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. In so doing, it will presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, the agency will aggregate them only where there exists a solid basis for determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, the agency will not require the requester to make an advance payment—in other words, a payment made before work is begun or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., a prepayment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.<PRTPAGE P="54"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester that has a history of prompt payment.</P>
            <P>(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any agency within 30 days of the date of billing, the agency may require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before it begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester.</P>
            <P>(4) In cases in which the agency requires advance payment or payment due under paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until the required payment is received.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</E> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In cases in which records responsive to requests are maintained for distribution by another agency under such a statutorily based fee schedule program, ACUS will inform the requesters of the steps for obtaining records from those sources so that they may do so most economically.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section where the agency determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:</P>
            <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(2) To determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, the agency will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.” The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
            <P>(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute”' to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities.</P>
            <P>(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to convey information effectively to the public will be considered. It will be presumed that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.</P>

            <P>(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. The agency will not make value judgments about whether information that would contribute significantly to public understanding of the <PRTPAGE P="55"/>operations or activities of the government is “important” enough to be made public.</P>
            <P>(3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, the agency will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. The agency will consider any commercial interest of the requester (with reference to the definition of “commercial use” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters will be given an opportunity in the administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
            <P>(ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether any identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is satisfied and that public interest is greater in magnitude than that of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The agency ordinarily will presume that where a news-media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed primarily to serve the public interest.</P>
            <P>(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.</P>
            <P>(5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the factors listed in paragraphs (k)(2) and (k)(3) of this section insofar as they apply to each request. The agency will exercise its discretion to consider the cost-effectiveness of its investment of administrative resources in this decisionmaking process in deciding to grant waivers or reductions of fees.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> This subpart contains the rules that the Administrative Conference of the United States (“ACUS” or “the agency”) follows under the Privacy Act of 1974 (“the Privacy Act”), 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended, regarding the protection of, and individual access to, certain records about individuals. These rules should be read together with and are governed by the Privacy Act itself, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. The rules in this subpart apply to all records in Privacy Act systems of records maintained by the agency, which are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request <PRTPAGE P="56"/>amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the agency. In addition, the agency processes all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552, <E T="03">as amended,</E> following the rules contained in subpart A of this part. Thus, all Privacy Act requests will be subject to exemptions for access to records only applicable under both FOIA and the Privacy Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this subpart:</P>
            <P>(1) “Request for access to a record” means a request made under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) “Request for amendment or correction of a record” means a request made under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) “Request for an accounting” means a request made under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3).</P>
            <P>(4) “Requester” means an individual who makes a request for access, a request for amendment or correction, or a request for an accounting under the Privacy Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> You may make a request for access to a record about yourself by appearing in person or by sending an e-mail message addressed to <E T="03">info@acus.gov.</E> You may also send a written request letter to the agency either by mail addressed to 1120 20th Street, NW., South Lobby, Suite 706, Washington, DC 20036, or by fax delivery to (202) 386-7190. For the quickest possible handling of a mail request, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Request.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> You must describe the records that you want in enough detail to enable agency personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should describe the records sought, the time periods in which you believe they were compiled, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you believe they are kept. The agency publishes a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that describes its systems of records.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> If you make a Privacy Act request for access to records, it will be considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under § 304.27, up to $50.00. Duplication fees in excess of $50.00 are subject to the requirements of § 304.27 of this subpart and the notification requirements in § 304.9 of subpart A. The agency ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> When you make a request for access to records about yourself, you must verify your identity. You must state your full name, current address, and date and place of birth. You must sign your request and your signature must either be notarized or submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In order to help the identification and location of requested records, you may also, entirely at your option, include the last four digits of your social security number.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 304.22</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responsibility for responding to requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The agency will be responsible for responding to a request in all respects, except in the case of a referral to another agency as is described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. In determining which records are responsive to a request, the agency ordinarily will include only records in its possession and control as of the date upon which it begins its search for them. If any other date is used, the agency will inform the requester of that date.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultations and referrals.</E> When the agency receives a request for access to a record in its possession and control, it will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government, is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from access under the Privacy Act. If the agency determines <PRTPAGE P="57"/>that it is the agency best able to process the record in response to the request, then it will do so. If it determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it will either:</P>
            <P>(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency that is best able to determine whether the record is exempt from access and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or</P>
            <P>(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the agency that is best able to determine whether it is exempt from access, or to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether it is exempt from access.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of referral.</E> When the agency refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it ordinarily will notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of the agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</E> All consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date upon which the Privacy Act access request was initially received by the first agency, not any later date.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.</E> The agency may make agreements with other agencies designed to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 304.23</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgments of requests.</E> On receipt of a request, the agency ordinarily will send an acknowledgment letter to the requester that will confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under § 304.21(c) and provide an assigned request number for further reference. In some cases, the agency may seek further information or clarification from the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grants of requests for access.</E> Once the agency makes a determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The agency will inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under § 304.27 and will disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a request is made in person, the agency may disclose records to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another person, the requester will be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests for access.</E> Upon making an adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect, the agency will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests consist of: a determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The notification letter will include:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
            <P>(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied in denying the request; and</P>
            <P>(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 304.24(a) and a description of the requirements of § 304.24(a).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals from denials of requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> If you are dissatisfied with the response to your request, you may appeal an adverse determination denying your request, in any respect, to the Chairman of the agency. You must make your appeal in writing, by e-mail or letter, and it must be received by the agency within 60 days of the date of the denial of your request. Your appeal letter should provide reasons and supporting information as to <PRTPAGE P="58"/>why the initial determination was incorrect. The appeal should clearly identify the particular determination (including the assigned request number, if known) that you are appealing. For the quickest possible handling of a mail request, you should mark your appeal letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Appeal.” The Chairman of the agency or his or her designee will act on the appeal, except that an appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes a matter of FOIA or Privacy Act litigation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Responses to appeals.</E> The decision on your appeal will be made in writing. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, including any exemption applied, and will inform you of the Privacy Act provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, then you will be notified in a written decision and your request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> As a general rule, if you wish to seek review by a court of any adverse determination or denial of a request, you must first appeal it under this section.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 304.25</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requests for amendment or correction of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> Unless the record is not subject to amendment or correction as stated in paragraph (f) of this section, you may make a request for amendment or correction of an ACUS record about yourself by following same procedures as in § 304.21. Your request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment or correction that you want, and state why you believe that the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. You may submit any documentation that you think would be helpful. If you believe that the same record is maintained in more than one system of records, you should state that.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency responses.</E> Within ten business days of receiving your request for amendment or correction of records, the agency will send you a written acknowledgment of its receipt of your request. The agency will promptly notify you whether your request is granted or denied. If the agency grants your request in whole or in part, it will describe the amendment or correction made and will advise you of your right to obtain a copy of the corrected or amended record, in disclosable form. If the agency denies your request in whole or in part, it will send you a letter that will state:</P>
            <P>(1) The reason(s) for the denial; and</P>
            <P>(2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of this section, including the name and business address of the official who will act on your appeal.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> You may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or correction in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see § 304.24(a)) and the same procedures will be followed. The agency will ordinarily act on the appeal within 30 business days of receipt of the appeal, except that the Chairman of the agency may extend the time for response for good cause shown. If your appeal is denied, you will be advised of your right to file a Statement of Disagreement as described in paragraph (d) of this section and of your right under the Privacy Act for court review of the decision.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Statements of Disagreement.</E> If your appeal under this section is denied in whole or in part, you have the right to file a Statement of Disagreement that states your reason(s) for disagreeing with the agency's denial of your request for amendment or correction. Statements of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for each fact disputed. The agency will place your Statement of Disagreement in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and will mark the disputed record to indicate that a Statement of Disagreement has been filed and exactly where in the system of records it may be found.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification of amendment/correction or disagreement.</E> Within 30 business days of the amendment or correction of a record, the agency will notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the <PRTPAGE P="59"/>record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended or corrected.

          <P>Federal agencies are required to publish regulations implementing the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(a)), the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579, 5 U.S.C. 552a), the Government in the Sunshine Act (Pub. L. 94-409, 5 U.S.C. 552b), and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978 (29 U.S.C. 794). While most agencies have existing chapter assignments in the Code of Federal Regulations, a few agencies do not. Since certain of these agencies are unlikely to be issuing regulations other than those relating to the acts mentioned above, the Director of the Office of the Federal Register has grouped these miscellaneous agencies into this chapter as an efficient means of administering the CFR system.</P>

          <P>(a) The system of records, as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974, maintained by the President's Commission on White House Fellowships is listed annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as required by that Act. Any person who wishes to know whether a system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her may either appear in person at Room 1308, 1900 E Street, NW., on work days between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. or may write to the President's Commission on White House Fellowships Administrative Officer, Washington, DC 20415 (Phone 202-382-4661). It is recommended that requests be made in writing.</P>
          <P>(b) Requests for notification of the existence of a record should state, if the requester is other than the individual to whom the record pertains, the relationship of the requester to that individual. (Note that requests will not be honored by the Commission pursuant to the Privacy Act unless made: (1) By the individual to whom the record pertains or (2) by such individual's legal guardian if the individual has been declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction.)</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission will acknowledge requests for the existence of records within 10 working days from the time it receives the request and will normally notify the requester of the existence or non-existence of records within 30 working days from receipt of request.</P>
          <P>(d) No special identity verification is required for individuals who wish to know whether a specific system of records pertains to them.</P>

The Commission will strive either to make the record available within 15 working days of the request or to inform the requester of the need for additional identification.</P>
          <P>(b) In the case of persons making requests by appearing at the Commission, reasonable identification such as employment identification cards, drivers licenses, or credit cards will normally be accepted as sufficient evidence of identity in the absence of any indications to the contrary.</P>

          <P>(c) Charges for copies of records will be at the rate of $0.10 per photocopy of each page. No charge will be made unless the charge as computed above would exceed $3 for each request or related series of requests.

Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or <PRTPAGE P="66"/>bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a money order.

          <P>(vi) Of his or her right to seek judicial review of the refusal to amend the record, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A).</P>

          <P>(a) It is the NCPC's general policy to facilitate the broadest possible availability and dissemination of information to the public through use of the NCPC's Web site, <E T="03">www.ncpc.gov</E>, and physical distribution of materials not available electronically. The NCPC <PRTPAGE P="73"/>staff shall be available to assist the public in obtaining information formally by using the procedures herein or informally in a manner not inconsistent with the rule set forth in this part. In addition, to the extent permitted by other laws, the NCPC will make available Agency Records of interest to the public that are appropriate for disclosure.</P>
          <P>(b) The NCPC possesses the administrative discretion in the context of individual Requests to release documents for no or reduced fees or to waive any of the NCPC's FOIA Request requirements in the interest of public disclosure of information eligible for disclosure under the Act.</P>

          <P>(a) The NCPC shall designate a Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer who shall be authorized to grant or deny any Request for a Record of the NCPC.</P>
          <P>(b) Requests for a Record or Records that is/are not available in the actual or electronic reading rooms shall be directed to the Chief Freedom of Information Act Officer.</P>

          <P>(c) All FOIA Requests shall be made in writing. If sent by U.S. mail, Requests should be sent to NCPC's official business address contained on the NCPC Web site. If sent via email, they should be directed to <E T="03">www.ncpc.gov.</E> To expedite internal handling of FOIA Requests, the words Freedom of Information Act Request shall appear prominently on the transmittal envelope or the subject line of a Request sent via email or facsimile.</P>
          <P>(d) The FOIA Request shall:</P>
          <P>(1) State that the Request is made pursuant to the FOIA;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe the Agency Record(s) Requested in sufficient detail including, without limitation, any specific information known such as date, title or name, author, recipient, or time frame for which you are seeking Records, to enable the NCPC personnel to locate the Requested Agency Records;</P>

          <P>(3) State, pursuant to the fee schedule set forth in § 456.14, a willingness to pay all fees associated with the FOIA Request or the maximum fee the Requester is willing to pay to obtain the Requested Records, unless the Requester is seeking a Fee Waiver or placement in a certain Requester Category;<PRTPAGE P="74"/>
          </P>
          <P>(4) State the desired form or format of disclosure of Agency Records with which the NCPC shall endeavor to comply unless compliance would damage or destroy an original Agency Record or reproduction is costly and/or requires the acquisition of new equipment; and</P>
          <P>(5) Provide a phone number or email address at which the Requester can be reached to facilitate the handling of the Request.</P>
          <P>(e) If a FOIA Request is unclear, overly broad, involves an extremely voluminous amount of Records or a burdensome Search, or fails to state a willingness to pay the requisite fees or the maximum fee which the Requester is willing to pay, the NCPC shall endeavor to contact the Requester to define the subject matter, identify and clarify the Records being sought, narrow the scope of the Request, and obtain assurances regarding payment of fees. The timeframe for a response set forth in § 456.7(a) shall be tolled (stopped temporarily) and the NCPC will not begin processing a Request until the NCPC obtains the information necessary to clarify the Request and/or clarifies issues pertaining to the fee.</P>

          <P>(a) The Freedom of Information Act Officer, upon receipt of a FOIA Request made in compliance with these rules, shall determine within 20 Workdays whether to grant or deny the Request. The Freedom of Information Officer shall within 20 Workdays notify the Requester in writing of his/her determination and the reasons therefore and of the right to appeal any Adverse Determination to the head of the NCPC.</P>
          <P>(b) If a Request is denied in whole or in part, the Chief FOIA Officer's written determination shall include, if technically feasible, the precise amount of information withheld, a brief description of the information withheld without revealing its content, and the exemption under which it is being withheld unless revealing the exemption would harm an interested protected by the exemption. NCPC shall release any portion of a withheld Record that reasonably can be segregated from the exempt portion of the Record.</P>
          <P>(c) In cases involving Unusual Circumstances, the Chief FOIA Officer may extend the 20 Workday time limit by written notice to the Requester. The written notice shall set forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension of more than 10 Working Days unless the Freedom of Information Act Officer affords the Requester an opportunity to modify his/her Request or arranges an alternative timeframe with the Requester for completion of the NCPC's processing.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Multi-track processing.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The NCPC may use multiple tracks for processing FOIA Requests based on the complexity of Requests and those for which expedited processing is Requested. Complexity shall be determined based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process a Request and/or the number of pages of responsive Records. If the NCPC utilizes Multi-track Processing, it shall advise a Requester when a Request is placed in a slower track of the limits associated with a faster track and afford the Requester the opportunity to limit the scope of its Request to qualify for faster processing.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Expedited processing.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The NCPC shall provide Expedited Processing of a FOIA Request if the person making the Request demonstrates that the Request involves:</P>
          <P>(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
          <P>(2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
          <P>(3) The loss of substantial due process rights; or</P>

          <P>(4) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exists possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.<PRTPAGE P="75"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) A Request for Expedited Processing may be made at the time of the initial FOIA Request or at a later time.</P>
          <P>(c) A Requester seeking Expedited Processing must submit a detailed statement setting forth the basis for the Expedited Processing Request. The Requester must certify in the statement that the need for Expedited Processing is true and correct to the best of his/her knowledge. To qualify for Expedited Processing, a Requester relying upon the category in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must establish:</P>
          <P>(1) He/she is a full time Representative of the News Media or primarily engaged in the occupation of information dissemination, though it need not be his/her sole occupation;</P>
          <P>(2) A particular urgency to inform the public about the information sought by the FOIA Request beyond the public's right to know about the government activity generally; and</P>
          <P>(3) The information is of the type that has value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly such as a breaking news story. Information of historical interest only or information sought for litigation or commercial activities will not qualify nor would a news media deadline unrelated to breaking news.</P>
          <P>(d) Within 10 calendar days of receipt of a Request for expedited processing, the NCPC shall decide whether to grant or deny the Request and notify the Requester of the decision in writing. If a Request for Expedited Processing is granted, the Request shall be given priority and shall be processed in the expedited processing track. If a Request for Expedited Processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Consultations and referrals.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Unless the NCPC determines that it is best able to process a Record in response to a FOIA Request, the NCPC shall either respond to the FOIA Request after consultation with the Agency best able to determine if the Requested Record(s) is/are subject to disclosure; or refer the responsibility for responding to the FOIA Request to the Agency responsible for originating the Record(s). Generally, the Agency originating a Record will be presumed by the NCPC to be the Agency best qualified to render a decision regarding disclosure or exemption except for Agency Records submitted to the NCPC pursuant to its authority to review Agency plans and/or projects.</P>
          <P>(b) Upon referral of a FOIA Request to another Agency, the NCPC shall notify the Requester in writing of the referral, inform the Requester of the name of the Agency to which all or part of the FOIA Request has been referred, provide the Requester a description of the part of the Request referred, and advise the Requester of a point of contact within the receiving Agency.</P>
          <P>(c) The timeframe for a response to a FOIA Request requiring consultation or referral shall be based on the date the FOIA Request was initially received by the NCPC and not any later date.</P>

          <P>(b) Whenever a Request is made for a Record that is designated Controlled Unclassified Information by another Agency, the NCPC shall refer the FOIA Request to the Agency that designated the Record as Controlled Unclassified Information. Decisions to disclose or withhold information designated as Controlled Unclassified Information shall be made based on the applicability of the statutory exemptions contained in the FOIA, not on a Controlled Unclassified Information marking or designation.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Confidential commercial information.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Confidential Commercial Information obtained by the NCPC from a Submitter shall be disclosed under the FOIA only in accordance with the requirements of this section.<PRTPAGE P="76"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) A Submitter of Confidential Commercial Information shall use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the Submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
          <P>(c) Notice shall be given to a Submitter of a FOIA Request for potential Confidential Commercial Information if:</P>
          <P>(1) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the Submitter as Confidential Commercial Information eligible for protection from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA; or</P>
          <P>(2) The NCPC has reason to believe the requested information is Confidential Commercial Information protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.</P>

          <P>(d) Subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section, the NCPC shall provide a Submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA Request or administrative appeal that seeks the Submitter's Confidential Commercial Information. The notice shall give the Submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that Confidential Commercial Information pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The notice shall either describe the Confidential Commercial Information Requested or include copies of the Requested Records or portions thereof containing the Confidential Commercial Information. When notice to a large number of Submitters is required, NCPC may provide notification by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish the intent of the notice requirement such as a newspaper, newsletter, the NCPC Web site, or the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(e) The NCPC shall allow a Submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section and shall specify within the notice the time period for response. If a Submitter has any objection to disclosure, it shall submit a detailed written statement. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the Confidential Commercial Information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, it must show why the Confidential Commercial Information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. If the Submitter fails to respond to the notice within the specified time, the NCPC shall consider this failure to respond as no objection to disclosure of the Confidential Commercial Information on the part of the Submitter, and NCPC shall proceed to release the requested information. A statement provided by the Submitter that is not received by NCPC until after the NCPC's disclosure decision has been made shall not be considered by the NCPC. Information provided by a Submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(f) The NCPC shall consider a Submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose Confidential Commercial Information. Whenever the NCPC decides to disclose Confidential Commercial Information over the objection of a Submitter, the NCPC shall give the Submitter written notice, which shall include:</P>
          <P>(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the Submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
          <P>(2) A description of the Confidential Commercial Information to be disclosed; and</P>
          <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.</P>
          <P>(g) The notice requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply if:</P>
          <P>(1) The NCPC determines that the Confidential Commercial Information is exempt under FOIA;</P>
          <P>(2) The Confidential Commercial Information has been published lawfully or has been officially made available to the public;</P>

          <P>(3) The Confidential Commercial Information's disclosure is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="77"/>the requirements of Executive Order 12600 (Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information); or</P>
          <P>(4) The designation made by the Submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous in which case the NCPC shall, within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date, give the Submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the Confidential Commercial Information.</P>
          <P>(h) Whenever a Requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of Confidential Commercial Information, the NCPC shall promptly notify the Submitter.</P>
          <P>(i) Whenever the NCPC provides a Submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, the NCPC shall also notify the Requester. Whenever the NCPC notifies a Submitter of its intent to disclose Requested Information under paragraph (f) of this section, the NCPC shall also notify the Requester. Whenever a Submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Commercial Information, the NCPC shall notify the Requester.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) An appeal of an Adverse Determination shall be made in writing to the Chairman of the Commission (Chairman). An appeal may be submitted via U.S. mail or other type of manual delivery service or via email or facsimile within 30 Workdays of the date of a notice of an Adverse Determination. To facilitate handling of an appeal, the words Freedom of Information Act Appeal shall appear prominently on the transmittal envelope or the subject line of a Request sent via electronic-mail or facsimile.</P>
          <P>(b) An appeal of an Adverse Determination shall include a detailed statement of the legal, factual or other basis for the Requester's objections to an Adverse Determination; a daytime phone number or email address where the Requester can be reached if the NCPC requires additional information or clarification regarding the appeal; copies of the initial Request and the NCPC's written response; and for an Adverse Determination of a Request for Expedited Processing or a Fee Waiver, a demonstration of compliance with the requirements of §§ 456.9(a) and (c) or 456.14(a) through (c) respectively.</P>

          <P>(c) The Chairman shall respond to an appeal of an Adverse Determination in writing within 20 Workdays of receipt. If the Chairman grants the appeal, the Chairman shall notify the Requester, and the NCPC shall make available copies of the Requested Records promptly thereafter upon receipt of the appropriate fee determined in accordance with § 456.14. If the Chairman denies the appeal in whole or in part, the letter to the Requester shall state the reason(s) for the denial, including the FOIA exemptions(s) applied; a statement that the decision is final; and notification of the Requester's right to seek judicial review of the denial in the District Court of the United States in either the locale in which the Requester resides, the locale in which the Requester has his/her principal place of business, or in the District of Columbia. The Chairman's letter of denial shall also advise the Requester that the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers mediation services to resolve disputes between a Requester and the NCPC as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Contact information for OGIS can be obtained from the OGIS Web site at <E T="03">ogis@nara.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(d) The NCPC shall not act on an appeal of an Adverse Determination if the underlying FOIA Request becomes the subject of FOIA litigation.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 456.14</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In responding to FOIA Requests, the NCPC shall charge the following fees unless a Fee Waiver has been granted under § 456.15.</P>
          <P>(1) Search Fees shall be as follows:</P>

          <P>(i) Search fees shall be charged for all Requests, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section. The NCPC may charge for time spent conducting a Search even if it fails to locate any responsive Records or if the <PRTPAGE P="78"/>NCPC withholds Records located based on a FOIA exemption.</P>
          <P>(ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for Requested Records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be calculated based on the average hourly General Schedule (GS) base salary, plus the District of Columbia locality payment, plus 16 percent for benefits, of employees in the following three categories: Staff Assistant (assigned at the GS 9-11 grades); Professional Personnel (assigned at the GS 11-13 grades); and Managerial Staff (assigned at the 14-15 grades). For a Staff Assistant the quarter hour fee to Search for and retrieve a Requested Record shall be $9.00. If a Search and retrieval cannot be performed entirely by a Staff Assistant, and the identification of Records within the scope of a Request requires the use of Professional Personnel, the fee shall be $12.00 for each quarter hour of Search time spent by Professional Personnel. If the time of Managerial Personnel is required, the fee shall be $18.00 for each quarter hour of Search time spent by Managerial Personnel.</P>
          <P>(iii) For a computer Search of Records, Requesters shall be charged the Direct Costs of creating a computer program, if necessary, and/or conducting the Search, although certain Requesters (as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) will be charged no Search fee and certain other Requesters (as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) will be entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual Search time without charge. These Direct Costs for a computer Search shall include the cost that is directly attributable to a Search for responsive Records, and the costs of the operator's salary for the time attributable to the Search.</P>
          <P>(2) Duplication fees shall be charged to all Requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this Section. For a paper photocopy of a Record (no more than one copy of which shall be supplied), the fee shall be 10 cents per page for single or double sided copies, 90 cents per page for 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 11 inch color copies, and $1.50 per page for color copies up to 11 × 17 inches per page. For copies produced by computer, and placed on an electronic data saving device or provided as a printout, the NCPC shall charge the Direct Costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. For other forms of Duplication, the NCPC shall charge the Direct Costs of that Duplication.</P>
          <P>(3) Review fees shall be charged to Requesters who make a Commercial Use Request. Review fees will be charged only for the NCPC initial Review of a Record to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular Record or portion thereof. No charge will be made for Review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, Records or portions thereof withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not applicable upon appeal may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies. If the NCPC determines a different exemption applies, the costs of that Review are chargeable. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a Search under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) The following limitations on fees shall apply:</P>
          <P>(1) No Search fee shall be charged for FOIA Requests made by Educational Institutions, Noncommercial Scientific Institutions, or Representatives of the News Media.</P>
          <P>(2) No Search or Review fees shall be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for Search or Review.</P>
          <P>(3) Except for Requesters of a Commercial Use Request, the NCPC shall provide without charge the first two hours of Search (or the cost equivalent) and the first 100 pages of Duplication (or the cost equivalent); and</P>
          <P>(4) Except for Requesters of a Commercial Use Request, no fee shall be charged for a Request if the total fee calculated under this section equals $50.00 or less.</P>

          <P>(5) The fee provisions of this section shall be cumulative. Requesters other than those making a Commercial Use Request shall not be charged a fee unless the total cost of a Search in excess of two hours plus the cost of Duplication in excess of 100 pages totals more than $50.00.<PRTPAGE P="79"/>
          </P>
          <P>(c) If the NCPC determines or estimates fees in excess of $50.00, the NCPC shall notify the Requester of the actual or estimated amount of total fees, unless in its initial Request the Requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those determined or estimated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated, the NCPC shall advise the Requester that the estimated fee constitutes only a portion of the total fee. If the NCPC notifies a Requester that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $50.00, the Request shall not be considered received for purposes of calculating the timeframe for a Response, and no further work shall be undertaken on the Request until the Requester agrees to pay the anticipated total fee. Any such agreement shall be memorialized in writing. A notice under this paragraph shall offer the Requester an opportunity to work with the NCPC to reformulate the Request to meet the Requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
          <P>(d) Apart from other provisions of this section, if the Requester asks for or the NCPC chooses as a matter of administrative discretion to provide a special service—such as certifying that Records are true copies or sending them by other than ordinary mail—the actual costs of special service shall be charged.</P>
          <P>(e) The NCPC shall charge interest on any unpaid fee starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the Requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 (Interest and Penalty on Claims) and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by the NCPC. The NCPC shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. No. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
          <P>(f) Where the NCPC reasonably believes that one or more Requesters are acting in concert to subdivide a Request into a series of Requests to avoid fees, the NCPC may aggregate the Requests and charge accordingly. The NCPC shall presume that multiple Requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees. Where Requests are separated by a time period in excess of 30 days, the NCPC shall aggregate the multiple Requests if a solid basis exists for determining aggregation is warranted under all circumstances involved.</P>
          <P>(g) Advance payments shall be treated as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) For Requests other than those described in paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section, the NCPC shall not require an advance payment. An advance payment refers to a payment made before work on a Request is begun or continued after being stopped for any reason but does not extend to payment owed for work already completed but not sent to a Requester.</P>
          <P>(2) If the NCPC determines or estimates a total fee under this section of more than $250.00, it shall require an advance payment of all or part of the anticipated fee before beginning to process a Request, unless the Requester provides satisfactory assurance of full payment or has a history of prompt payment.</P>
          <P>(3) If a Requester previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to the NCPC within 30 days of the date of billing, the NCPC shall require the Requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before the NCPC begins to process a new Request or continues processing a pending Request from that Requester.</P>
          <P>(4) If the NCPC requires advance payment or payment due under paragraphs (g)(2) or (3) of this section, the Request shall not be considered received and no further work will be undertaken on the Request until the required payment is received.</P>
          <P>(h) Where Records responsive to Requests are maintained for distribution by Agencies operating statutorily based fee schedule programs, the NCPC shall inform Requesters of the steps for obtaining Records from those sources so that they may do so most economically.</P>
          <P>(i) All fees shall be paid by personal check, money order or bank draft drawn on a bank of the United States, made payable to the order of the Treasurer of the United States.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 456.15</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fee waiver requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Records responsive to a Request shall be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established under § 456.14 if the Requester demonstrates to the NCPC, and the NCPC determines, based on all available information, that Disclosure of the Requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the Requester.</P>
          <P>(b) To determine if disclosure of the Requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, the Requester shall demonstrate, and NCPC shall consider, the following factors:</P>
          <P>(1) Whether the subject of the Requested Records concerns the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the Requested Records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
          <P>(2) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities. The portions of the Requested Records eligible for disclosure must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, is not likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations and activities because this information is already known.</P>
          <P>(3) Whether disclosure of the Requested information will contribute to public understanding. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the Requester. A Requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a Representative of the News Media satisfies this consideration.</P>
          <P>(4) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure. The NCPC shall not make value judgments about whether information that would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government is important enough to be made public.</P>
          <P>(c) To determine whether disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the Requester, the Requester shall demonstrate, and NCPC shall consider, the following factors:</P>
          <P>(1) Whether the Requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the Requested disclosure. The NCPC shall consider any commercial interest of the Requester (with reference to the definition of Commercial Use Request in § 456.3(f)), or of any person on whose behalf the Requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the Requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity in the administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>

          <P>(2) Whether any identified commercial interest of the Requester is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the Requester. A Fee Waiver is justified where the public interest standard of paragraph (b) of this section is satisfied and that public interest is greater in magnitude than that of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The NCPC ordinarily shall presume that a Representative of the News Media satisfies the public interest standard, and the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that Requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.<PRTPAGE P="81"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) Where only some of the Records to be released satisfy the requirements for a Fee Waiver, a Fee Waiver shall be granted for those Records.</P>
          <P>(e) Requests for a Fee Waiver should address the factors listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, insofar as they apply to each Request. The NCPC shall exercise its discretion to consider the cost-effectiveness of its investment of administrative resources in this decision-making process in deciding to grant Fee Waivers.</P>

          <P>(b) Materials that are responsive to a FOIA Request shall not be disposed of or destroyed while the Request or a related lawsuit is pending even if the Records would otherwise be authorized for disposition under the NCPC's General Records Schedule or NARA or other NARA-approved records schedule.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 457.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 457.150</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 457.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by <PRTPAGE P="85"/>a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 457.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 457.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>

          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 457.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—<PRTPAGE P="91"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 500.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 500.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 500.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—<PRTPAGE P="92"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Communications.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 500.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
